Kids Yoga classes are a playful and engaging way to help children increase the strength and flexibility of their minds and their bodies. We use stories, games, music, and play to learn movements, breathing techniques, meditation, and relaxation. Most of all, we learn how to relax enough to be ourselves and to shine like the sun. Monday classes (ages 7-12) focus on concentration, balance, and more challenging poses, though they are also based in play. Wednesday classes (ages 4-8) are for younger ones and have more games and songs.
