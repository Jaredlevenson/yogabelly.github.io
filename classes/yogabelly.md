blurb: Our beginner-friendly class
---

Yoga Belly is our "core-centric" class where we focus on isolation and work primarily with key core muscles also known as the three classic yoga bandhas: mula, uddiyana, and jalandhara bandhas. This dynamic core class also includes foundations of flow (breathing through movement) in a heated room to loosen up your muscles. The Yoga Belly sequence moves from floor work to standing poses, then balancing to seated poses, and beyond. When practiced regularly, Yoga Belly will help tone, tighten, and strengthen your abs as well as help you develop a powerful yoga practice. This class is great for beginners, yet all levels are welcome!

Non-heated Yoga Belly classes are offered on Tuesdays and Thursdays at lunchtime for those who want a cooler way to practice.
