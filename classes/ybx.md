YBX is a fusion style yoga class that combines the physicality of a yoga class with the influence and style of other forms of physical training. Each class varies in style and influence based on the instructor and his/her experiences. YBX offers the following in classes:

- An exploration of all the yoga poses fused with other influences from other schools of physical expression
- Heated to 85 - 90 degrees (non-heated weekday lunch)
- Music

YBX is challenging and intense yet still empowering! Please check out the assigned teacher's bio for details on what he/she brings in his/her YBX class.
