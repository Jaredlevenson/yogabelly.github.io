   Aaron &amp; William started practicing yoga in 2005.
   They became notorious in the community for hosting wild parties where they encouraged their peers to let down their hair and be a little naughty.
   Both certified yoga teachers, they came up with the idea of starting their own studio for non-traditional yogis who love yoga primarily for the physical practice.
   Aaron &amp; William founded Yoga Belly in 2010 in the heart of Mountain View, CA.
   With the support of their fabulous team, Yoga Belly is a unique studio that proudly offers wicked sequencing, funky playlists, and a disco ball.

   Aaron &amp; William thank you for checking out Yoga Belly where we are light on tradition, heavy on workout.
