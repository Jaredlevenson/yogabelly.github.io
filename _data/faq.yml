  - question: Bring it.
    answer: >
      Bring your mat and a towel (rentals available when needed), water bottle or
      buy bottled water in our fridge, and maybe a change of clothes for after coz
      you're gonna be sweaty after class - we promise. Oh! And don't forget to
      bring your yogi mojo too!

  - question: The Duds.
    answer: >
      Slap on some secure athletic wear that will be suitable for some sweet
      hardcore movement and deep stretching. Ooo la la.

  - question: Personal Effects.
    answer: |
      We've got cubbies to hold your personal belongings in the back of the
      practice space. Please help us keep the lobby clutter free and use the
      storage space provided.

      Psst! Don't forget to turn off your cell phone and remove your shoes before
      entering the practice space.

  - question: Baby it's warm inside.
    answer: >
      To make your muscles loose and happy, our studio gets warm to a nice
      tropical 90 deg. Get ready to sweat it out and detox that hot bod!

  - question: Props please?
    answer: >
      We will hook you up with all your block and strap needs.

  - question: Towels?
    answer: >
      Since you will be sweating your asanas (poses) off in class, a full size
      towel on your mat will help you from turning your yoga mat into a slip 'n
      slide. Bring your own towel coz you'll need it! If needed, you can always
      rent one from us.

  - question: The H<sub>2</sub>O Question.
    answer: >
      Keep hydrated! Before you bust your butt in class drink lots of the good
      stuff and then small amounts during the class, and then plenty post yoga
      class too. Bring your own water bottle & grab some nice cool water from our
      lounge or buy one from our fridge.

  - question: Hey Mr. DJ put a record on.
    answer: >
      Every teacher cranks out their own specialized playlist of tunes to get you
      and the class bumpin.

  - question: Not so hot for teacher?
    answer: >
      Not feeling it for a class with a certain teacher? Not a problem! Try
      another one, we have a great variety of teachers who all bring their own
      unique flava, one of which you're bound to connect with. Give every teacher
      a second shot as there are so many factors that go into making that magical
      yoga experience. You may be surprised how well we do the second time around.

  - question: Body's got a boo boo.
    answer: >
      If you have a health concern or injury it's always best to consult your
      health care provider before beginning yoga. When you join us for class just
      be sure to let the teacher know so they can provide you with the necessary
      modifications. We want to help not hinder our boo boo after all.

  - question: Will my baby belly be ok?
    answer: >
      If you are pregnant always play it safe and check with your health care
      provider first, and be sure to let the teacher know before class, but many
      hot yogi-mommas-to-be practice till full term when they already have an
      existing practice.

  - question: Look, don't touch.
    answer: >
      At times during class our teachers may offer an adjustment to your form as
      we are a touchy-feely-we-wanna-give-a-hug kind of studio. They are
      experienced and certified and aren't trying to get frisky with ya, but might
      be helping out to prevent injury or assist you to go deeper into a pose.
      Don't want to be touched? That's OK! Let us know and we will respect your
      wishes.
