# Yoga Belly website

This will eventually replace the current Yoga Belly Studio website.
I'd built previous versions of it in PHP using Codeigniter, then python using Flask, but really there's no reason any of this needs to be dynamic.

I heard of Jekyll earlier today, and figured why not give it a try and see how it comes out. As an added bonus, github will host it for free!

I had a few adventures learning some of the basics beyond the what's in the official Jekyll docs, and if you're in the same shoes I hope this code repo is helpful to you!
