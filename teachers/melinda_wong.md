Melinda started practicing yoga as a way to mentally and physically slow down throughout high school and college. After graduating from UCLA with a degree in Psychobiology in 2012, she began working in a psychiatry research lab at Stanford University. In 2015, feeling ready for a change, Melinda left her research job to attend a YogaWorks 200-hour yoga teacher training in Bali, Indonesia. There, she studied under the guidance of Alicia Cheung and Oliver Reinsch, delving deep into yoga anatomy, philosophy, and practice.

Melinda believes that yoga is for every body. She teaches fun and dynamic flow classes that are accessible to all levels - music is always on and sweat level is always high. She especially enjoys working with beginners and providing hands-on adjustments throughout class. Her teaching style draws upon her background in both anatomy and mental health, blending movement and alignment principles with steady breath to cultivate a strong mind-body awareness.

Outside of yoga, Melinda continues to analyze data at the research lab and works at lululemon athletica. She also enjoys boxing, hiking, and most other sweaty endeavors!
