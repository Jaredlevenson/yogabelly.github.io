From a young age I had always been active. Studying classical ballet in Sydney, AU then receiving a black belt in Tae Kwon Do before entering college, and regular gym exercise after that. After a set routine, I was looking for something different and a friend persuaded to try Yoga Belly. After several failed yoga attempts, I decided give yoga another try. From the first class, I was hooked. The challenge of flowing and being mindful of the breath and body was something I wasn't aware of through other workouts.

Finishing Yoga Belly's teacher training and mentoring under Yoga Belly's own Sean and Loran Loosli, I was able to expand my yoga practice. I'd like to share my love of yoga and Yoga Belly to others and hope to open them up to their potential and find their strength. After all, I too am still a student!

Outside of yoga, I work in commercial property management, love to hike, and like to smoosh my dog's face because he's so gosh darn cute!
