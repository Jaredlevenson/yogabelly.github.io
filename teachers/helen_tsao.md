Helen's yoga journey started with a Crunch Fitness yoga video while attending law school in 2001. Yoga was seen as a way to release stress and workout when she didn't get a chance to go to the gym. Yoga became her saving grace while studying for the bar, but it wasn't until several years later she actually practiced at a gym or studio. Yoga Belly was one of the first studios that she attended regularly, and she found the community to be inviting and friendly. She also loved that the classes were rigorous enough that she can get a great workout for her body, mind and soul all at the same time. As her practice has deepened, she has been able to take the lessons from yoga off the mat and has integrated its teachings into her daily life. Helen completed her 200-hour teacher training in 2014 and just completed her 70-hour Yoga Belly training this year. She is grateful that she is able to join the Yoga Belly family and share her practice with its community.
