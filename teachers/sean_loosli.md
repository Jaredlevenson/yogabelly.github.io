Sean began practicing yoga somewhat skeptically, reluctantly coming along with his wife. As a long-time member of our studio staff, he has since become independently interested and passionate about his practice. He is excited about making the poses and practice accessible to all -- particularly those who are just starting out or may not see themselves as stereotypical yogis. His yoga practice is a constant balance between accepting what is while also striving for more just like the rest of his life. Sean is a sports nut who will jump into any type of pickup game, and loves the great cross-training for strength, flexibility, and balance that a yoga practice provides. Sean completed his introductory teacher training here at YB with William Cristobal. He also works as a product manager for an online banking software company in the Bay area.
