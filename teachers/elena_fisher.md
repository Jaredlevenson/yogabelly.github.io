Elena truly believes that yoga is a practice, and that we all continue to improve our practice with each class we take. She loves working with students who are new to yoga, especially those who are a bit hesitant in the beginning. Her classes are a combination of movement, music, and fun with focus on breath. One of her major goals is to de- mystify the practice, so that everyone can leave feeling refreshed, relaxed, and a little more flexible.

Elena currently lives in Los Gatos, enjoying many of the wonderful California outdoor activities, such as running, cycling, swimming, hiking, and fishing. She also loves spending time with her family, including her two Pugs. When Elena isn't busy leading awesome classes, you will find her designing her own line of handmade clothing.
