Anfisa's yoga journey started when she moved to the US in 2012 from St. Petersburg, Russia. In the beginning Anfisa was interested more in spiritual aspects of yoga (philosophy, meditation). Soon she tried a physical practice and her body naturally responded "YES," it was love at the first sight. Anfisa started practicing daily. With a strong desire to help people bring more awareness into their body and mind through yoga, Anfisa was inspired and became a yoga teacher by earning her Yoga Alliance 200 hours Teacher Training and 70 hours from Yoga Tune Up.

Anfisa integrates traditional yoga with different types of movements and techniques that helps to build strength and flexibility, coordination, and joint mobility.
