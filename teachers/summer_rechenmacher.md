Summer took her first class at Yoga Belly in 2011. She had tried many studios over the years and did prenatal yoga during her pregnancies with her daughters, but didn't really "get" yoga until she found Yoga Belly. She came to the studio to mix up her workouts and fell in love from the very first class. Not only because of how great it made her feel, but also how much fun she had and the amazing energy of the Yoga Belly community. What followed was a wonderful transformation. As Summer gained the strength and confidence to do challenging poses and arm balances that once seemed so daunting, she gained so much more. Yoga has enriched her health, outlook, and total being. She wanted to share the joy she experienced so she completed Yoga Belly's Teacher Apprenticeship program and has begun her journey in sharing the incredible benefits of yoga so others, too, can have fun while experiencing their truly amazing transformations. Summer encourages her students to break out of their comfort zone and grow to realize their full potential both on and off the mat.
