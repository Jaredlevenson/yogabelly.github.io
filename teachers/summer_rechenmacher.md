Summer took her first class at Yoga Belly in 2011. She had tried many studios over the years and did prenatal yoga during her pregnancies with her daughters, but didn’t really “get” yoga until she found Yoga Belly. She came to the studio to mix up her workouts and fell in love from the very first class. Not only because of how great it made her feel, but also how much fun she had and the amazing energy of the Yoga Belly community. What followed was a wonderful transformation. As Summer gained the strength and confidence to do challenging poses and arm balances that once seemed so daunting, she gained so much more. Yoga has enriched her health, outlook, and total being. She wanted to share the joy she experienced so she completed Yoga Belly’s Teacher Apprenticeship program and began her journey in sharing the incredible benefits of yoga so others, too, can have fun while experiencing their truly amazing transformations.  Summer earned her 200-hour yoga certification. 

She encourages her students to break out of their comfort zone and grow to realize their full potential both on and off the mat.  Summer's dynamic flow based classes are athletically challenging yet playful and fun.  She emphasizes connecting the breath with each movement and encourages her students to listen to their bodies and the sensations they are feeling so they move with self-awareness through their practice.  Summer believes that this is your time on the mat so get out of it what you need at this moment and move in a way that is therapeutic and feels good to you.
