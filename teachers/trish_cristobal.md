Trish’s love for health and physical fitness began in 2007 after she completed her first triathlon. From there it went to being committed to high intensity interval training, to running, and to weight lifting. She also enjoys the occasional adventure racing. After experiencing the benefits from living a healthy lifestyle and the strong desire to encourage others she then became a certified holistic personal trainer. Shortly after, she decided to add yoga to her life, and is now experiencing even more fulfillment, both spiritually and physically. Yoga is now enriching her meditation times and her body is free of aches and pains and now has increased mobility, flexibility and performance. Wanting to spread the gift of yoga, Trish completed Yoga Belly's 70-hour Yoga Belly Teacher Training, then just a few months after went back for more and earned her 200-hour RYT. Trish believes that yoga plays a big part in becoming the best version of yourself, to love others and to take on life as the adventure it’s meant to be.
