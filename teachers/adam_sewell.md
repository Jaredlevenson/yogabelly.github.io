Adam has been involved professionally in the wellness industry since 1990, once owned his own fitness center in Colorado, and has written several fitness manuals. He has trained various "special populations" from children to para-Olympic athletes to seniors. Having spent many years training with Billy Blanks, training in TaeBo and Karate, Adam spent years focusing on martial arts style fitness programs but has now gravitated to Tai Chi and Yoga for his own personal fitness/wellness training. He practices Tai Chi for health and as a martial art. Adam's original training in Yoga came via Dao Yin and Iyengar Yoga, which he used to rehabilitate a back injury. He received very strict Iyengar training without the usual props commonly used in that style. He has also practiced Yoga with John McAfee, the yoga guru and creator of McAfee software at his Relational Yoga Mandiram in the mountains above Colorado Springs. Adam's self-described teaching style is to "keep your ego out of the studio and just have fun with your students," which is why he calls it 'playing' Yoga. He is quoted as saying, "I'm not a teacher. I just play Yoga... some people follow."

Being an animal lover, Adam enjoys supporting various international animal charities and can frequently be found chatting with dogs on the streets of Los Gatos where he currently resides.
