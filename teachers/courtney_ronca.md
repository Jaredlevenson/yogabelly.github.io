Courtney first discovered yoga while living overseas in Japan, Once she moved back to the states in 2005 she began to deepen her practice. By developing a consistent yoga practice, she saw many incredible benefits in her life and decided to take her practice deeper.

Upon her move to California in 2007, Courtney met her teacher and mentor Anirudh Shastri and completed the 200 hour teacher training program in Avalon. Feeling drawn to tradition, she later completed both her 200 and 500 hour teacher training programs with Sri Dharma Mittra. Courtney feels extremely lucky and grateful to be able to learn and study with such incredible teachers. She continues to devote her life to the practice and discipline of yoga, integrating it into her life and sharing it with her students.

Courtney has a knack for making the impossible possible for students. With a specialty of breaking down complex poses, and making them attainable.
