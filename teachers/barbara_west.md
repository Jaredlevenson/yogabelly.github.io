Barbara came to Yoga through the health and fitness doors of various gyms where she found boundless possibilities in each class she attended. She practiced yoga off and on for many years and in 2009 made the decision to enroll in a 200 hour HathaYoga Teachers Training at Mind Body Zone. During her teachers training, she realized that yoga was unique and something she could take beyond the physical practice on the mat and extend into her day-to-day life. For her, Yoga presented this beautiful opportunity to accept where you are and acknowledge the opportunity for growth. She's grateful for the amazing teachers she's been blessed to practice with and continue to learn from.

Barbara has been a part of the fitness industry for over 12 years. She's a certified Personal Trainer Counselor through the Aerobics and Fitness Association of America (AFAA). She provides private and group training sessions in addition to teaching classes in Gliding, Mat Pilates, Body Sculpt and Indoor/Outdoor Bootcamp. Her experiences tell her that deep learning comes from teaching experiences in which "students" are also "teachers" that helps cultivate your practice. Her yoga philosophy is simple "every single person can do yoga; they just need to show up".
