From an early age, Dustin was heavily involved in acrobatics and tumbling. Nothing deep or philosophical, it was mainly just good fun. After realizing that to progress further he would need to compete, he soon dropped these activities, never quite taking an interest in competitive sports. During his freshman year in high school, Dustin attended his first yoga studio that was really nothing more than a standalone room apart from the local gym with ten space heaters and no humidifier (In Hawaii humidity was never a problem). He took a scorching Ashtanga Vinyasa Primary class full of other local odd yogis, wandering Rastafarians, and strange travelers. The air felt like fire, the flow was intoxicating, and the breathing was liberating. This is when Dustin really fell in love with Tantra, with movement and breath. Chasing his love of yoga, Dustin moved to San Jose in the summer of 2010 in order to take Mark Stephens 200 hr yoga teacher training in Santa Cruz.

Drawing his biggest inspiration from exploring the human form, Dustin tries to spread the passion for discovering the potential of the human body in every class. Dustin is currently a Massage Therapist in training at National Holistic Institute College of Massage Therapy.
