Rebecca has distinct memories falling over in a basic forward fold doing yoga for the first time. It was a beginners DVD. She'd sigh in relief when the instructor got to the laying down poses, and every time he said "externally rotate your groin muscles" she'd fight to keep a serious yogi face. Rebecca recently completed her 200 hour teacher training but she's still working on mastering the forward fold. There's so much to learn with each new try! So if you're just starting out, she gets you. Yoga IS weird. But awesomely so. She invites you to stick with it and join her in class. And she promises not to say "externally rotate your groin." Too often, anyways.
