Sarah began practicing yoga regularly in 2002 as a way to relieve stress from her work as a psychiatric nurse. After returning to her native Colorado in 2004, she discovered power yoga influenced by Baron Baptiste vinyasa flow style. It was there that she developed a true and healthy addiction to her practice. As she progressed, she found she craved deeper knowledge. She completed her 200 hour certification in 2005. Since then she has taken an interest in a diverse range of levels and cliental. She has enjoyed combining her professional experience by teaching adolescents with mental illness in order to provide greater balance and bring a proactive, holistic healing element to their treatment. Sarah believes strongly in the power of yoga practice, and the community it fosters, to help individuals cultivate greater physical and mental health.

Sarah's classes are rooted in the belief that everyone benefits from exploring their own potential. She strives to create a playful and energetic environment through music and movement that takes her students to another level.
