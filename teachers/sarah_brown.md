After returning to her native Colorado in 2004, she discovered power yoga influenced by Baron Baptiste vinyasa flow style. It was there that she developed a true and healthy addiction to her practice. As she progressed, she found she craved deeper knowledge. She completed her 200 hour certification in 2005. Since then she has taken an interest in a diverse range of levels and cliental. She has enjoyed combining her professional experience by teaching adolescents with mental illness in order to provide greater balance and bring a proactive, holistic healing element to their treatment.
