William and his hubby Aaron were simply trying out new experiences when they first moved to Palo Alto, CA. They jumped on an opportunity to volunteer their time at a yoga studio in exchange for free classes and they got hooked on the practice instantly. After hosting a party where they met the lovely owner of their yoga studio, William was inspired to take teacher training with the intent of adding flavor to the practice. Soon he earned his 200-RYT, attended multiple trainings, and started teaching part-time pretty much everywhere, and became known for offering funkdafied yoga classes while cranking up dance, hip hop, and pop music. William co-founded Yoga Belly with Aaron where you'll find their disco ball in the middle of the studio, where you are encouraged to have a good time.

William joined Lululemon as a loyal and dedicated ambassador in 2011 and still rocks that title to this day. His random experiences includes a cameo appearance on the hit show Dating Naked, and his claim to fame is being a featured teacher at Wanderlust Squaw Valley 2015, thanks to Lululemon! William is happily teaching for over 9 years now and is celebrating the success of Yoga Belly since 2010. He loves Madonna and is blissfully continuing his journey with Aaron, the man who truly brings him joy, and their sweet little doggies Chewie, Rocco, and Baby Gurl.
