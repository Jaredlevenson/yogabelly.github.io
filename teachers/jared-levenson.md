In college Jared befriended a zen priest, started an on-campus zen and meditation club, sat silent vipassana retreats, and lived as a Thai monk, and stayed in various monasteries. After completing his degree in economics and contemplating a research career, Jared did a 180 and moved to a zen mountain monastery off the California coast. During his 1 year stint in the wilderness Jared lived with monks and studied with yoga teachers. He took a liking to yoga and now attends Santa Clara University as a graduate student in psychology. He considers himself to be equally introverted and extroverted, loves entrepreneurship and self-improvement, drinks coffee and green smoothies, and is a science nerd. Find him on the mat and say "Your yoga belly bio says to say Hi!"
