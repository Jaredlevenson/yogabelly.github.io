Jeff Lang is a certified Yoga Tune UpÂ® instructor in the San Francisco Bay area. His focus is on therapeutic alignment, musculature balance, and exploring range of motion. He brings a very anatomical and physiological awareness to the classical mechanics of hatha yoga. When fun and intelligence combine with breath and compassion, Jeff leaves us with a very real deep connection to well-being and peace.

He trained at the Avalon Art & Yoga Center in Palo Alto, and has studied under Jill Miller since 2008. Jeff brings a wide variety of experience from Shadow Yoga, Vinyasa, Yin, Restorative, Classical Hatha, and Iyengar to plyometric exercises he gleaned during his hockey-playing days and physical therapy exercises. His intense self-study gives him an authentic voice whether presenting a meditative insight or a new sequence. You will have fun, learn, and feel welcome in any of Jeff's classes.
