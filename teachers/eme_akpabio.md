After many years thinking of herself as 'not a gym person,' Eme changed her mind. This decision lead to at least two cool discoveries: (1) the joy of getting a sweat on at 6am, (2) yoga. After getting past the initial frustration of not knowing how to do anything, she settled into a regular practice and got hooked on the movement and the stillness. Eme was in the first class of Yoga Belly teacher training grads, earning a 200-hour Frog Lotus YTT certification. She hopes each student leaves her class a bit sweat-soaked and with a sense of well-being.
