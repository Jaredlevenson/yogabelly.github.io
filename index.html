  <h3>Hi!</h3>

  <p>
   We're Aaron and Will, we want to bring you the best yoga experience we can, etc, come up with a good blurb about yourselves.
   Make it a couple paragraphs long and stuff like that. Explain why people should care about yoga, about yoga belly, and possibly also you specifically.
   Light on tradition, heavy on workout!
  </p>

  <p>
   You can also use this space to talk about things that are particularly important to you, and also upcoming events if you like.
  </p>

  <p>
   Come work out with us!
