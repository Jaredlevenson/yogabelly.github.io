   Aaron &amp; William started practicing yoga in 2005.
   They became notorious in the community for hosting wild parties where they encouraged their peers to let down their hair and be a little naughty.
   Both certified yoga teachers, they came up with the idea of starting their own studio for non-traditional yogis who love yoga primarily for the physical practice.
   Aaron &amp; William founded Yoga Belly in 2010 in the heart of Mountain View, CA then opened Yoga Belly San Jose in 2013.
   With the support of their fabulous team, Yoga Belly is a unique studio that proudly offers wicked sequencing, funky playlists, and a disco ball.

   Aaron &amp; William thank you for checking out Yoga Belly where we are light on tradition, heavy on workout.
