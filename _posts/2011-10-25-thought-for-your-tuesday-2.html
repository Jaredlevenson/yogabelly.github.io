<p>... especially in yoga. Especially when Edna has you kundalini-ing so hard you fling your barrette AND your hair tie at the wall in front of you, and you just keep breathing through it anyway (because what the hell else are you going to do), and when the longest minute of your life is finally (somehow) over, you look like you just came out of a mosh pit.</p>
