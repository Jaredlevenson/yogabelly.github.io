<p>Happy Monday yogis and yoginis! I am grudgingly back from Puerto Vallarta, a little tanner, with a little cold, and with a yoga-less week behind me... I'm jonesing for my yoga fix, hard core.</p>
<p>Luckily, we've got a ton of events coming up! For those of you who missed the email (or just need to hear things twice):</p>
<h3>Date Night</h3>
<p>Date night returns on Friday, October 21! Led by Edna and Rodney, couples can enjoy an evening learning partner yoga and Thai massage. Space will be limited to 12 couples.

Party goes from 8-11pm... Bring a friend like Jane Fonda or Richard Simmons.</p>
