<p>Day 18 of the 30 Day challenge and I made a date with Tiffany to practice yoga together. I woke up at 5:45am in order to make sure I had enough time to do everything that I needed to do in order to get to Yoga on time. William came with me and Tiffany was already there. She greeted me with a hug and a smile first thing in the morning. Rociel was doing check in so we had an opportunity to meet. Rociel had sent me the sweetest note about the blog the other day and we hadn’t had the opportunity to meet in person. I was excited to put a face to a name.  Morgan was there to try Thoa for the first time.  Stan and Anna and I talked about the 30 Day Challenge. Kathleen is over in her corner. Eli is in the back of the room. William , Tiffany and I practice over in the corner and Thoa takes us on a journey. 60 minutes later I pull myself up from Shivasan and am making small talk and saying my goodbyes as I head out to start my day. Not a bad way to start my Friday. Business as usual at the Belly on a Friday morning.<br />
I’ve been experimenting with my practice a lot lately. I’m working on taking a second pushup in my vinyasa. I can do it for a while with my knees up but eventually I tire. So in order to increase strength I come forward into my plank and lower down. Roll over the toes and come into Up Dog without dropping my knees. Lower the knees and take the second push-up and push back into my Down Dog. Something is changing in my practice and my shape is changing. I have this sweater that I wear on occasion and I usually don’t button it up cause it’s a big snug and I don’t try to draw attention to my love handles. The other day I threw it on and buttoned it up and it hung loose. For the first time I realized, my shape is changing. Talk about a little extra pep in your step.<br />
I’ve also been trying to engage in a self massage routine. I have a couple of balls and a bag that Jeff gave me lying around the house and after he gave me the pep talk about self massage and how if you’re going to have a daily practice you have to have a self massage practice I decided to give it a try. After about 3 minutes of rolling around on it trying to figure out what I am doing I realized….I don’t know what I am doing. I decided that I was going to start with what feels good and after a week or so I can now roll out my back and neck and shoulders to a point that makes a difference. I roll it out in the evenings as needed and when I wake up I don’t have that same level of stiffness. It really makes a difference. I’m still trying to figure out how to relieve my hips and legs but it’s a start and I am still going strong.<br />
So many changes, so many steps forward in my practice and in the way I get myself to my mat every day. It’s an exciting place to be 18 days in. I hope you all are experiencing the same kind of milestones in your daily practice and I would love to hear about it. My e-mail address is aaron@yogabellystudio.com or share on Facebook if you’re up for the public eye.  I have received notes from people that tell me they read the blog or see people in the studio that tell me they are reading it but I would never know based on Facebook. If you have made it to the end and have read this blog, please Like it on Facebook so I know I am not standing out here on the ledge by myself. I appreciate the support you all have shown me and the kind words. It really means a lot. We love harnessing the group energy for the power of good here at Yoga Belly, we love hearing from you. Day 18 yoga….check!<br />
Much Love,<br />
