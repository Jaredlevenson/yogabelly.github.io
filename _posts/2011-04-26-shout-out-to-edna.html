<p>Dearest yogis, </p>
<p>As many of you already know, our lovely Edna Barr is off to Bali until July. We are in capable yoga-hands until then, but we'll still miss her terribly.</p>
<p>Edna is the instructor who first introduced me to yoga. I mean, <em>real</em> yoga. Before that, I had done a few classes at 24 Hour, spent most of the time breathing and maaaaaaybe doing a sun salutation or two, but nothing that actually got me to sweat. Or focus. Or take yoga seriously. </p>
<p>Then I came to Edna's class. And in less than ten minutes, she had me sweating and shaking so hard in my low plank that I spent half the class in child's pose. During the last part of class, while we were doing backbends, I was flailing around, fingers grazing my calves, trying to get into camel pose. She came over, grabbed my hips, and said, "You've got plenty of space. Fire it up, Mama." </p>
<p>And then my hands were on my feet. Solidly, soundly, somehow, on my feet. </p>
<p>That's just the first in what turned out to be a long line of moments where Edna got me to do things I didn't realize I could do. All the teachers at Yoga Belly have done this: realized things about their students that we didn't know ourselves. But Edna was my first. As Will would say, after that, I was no longer a "yoga virgin."</p>
<p>It's such a strange feeling!</p>
<p>So, what about you? What's your favorite Edna-moment? Or a time where an instructor got you to do things you didn't think you could do?</p>
