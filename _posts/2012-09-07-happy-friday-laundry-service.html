          Happy Friday everyone. I hope this blog finds you all happy and healthy and living life to the fullest.<br />
          I often tell people when they ask what it’s like to own a yoga studio that its everything that you think its going to be plus a lot of work 7 days a week plus folding towels. Everyday usually starts and ends with some form of towel service. The pick up, the drop off, the change to the dryer, the fold… the never-ending cycle of towels that are needed by a yoga studio is something that I didn’t plan for when we dreamed of what it would be like to bring our dream for Yoga Belly to fruition. Today as I am on conference calls I run downstairs to grab a cup of coffee and see a black trash bag full of wet towels on the floor. This means that there was so many sweaty towels that it needed to be broken up into two loads. I don’t hear the washer so I say to myself, they must be ready to put into the dryer. As I clean out the lint trap and then load up the dryer I pick up someone’s bra out of the washer and throw it into the dryer and my thought was, “ Can you wash and dry a sports bra?” and my second thought is, “ Is that a sports bra, it looks like it has a pad in it?” and my third thought is, “ Why would you know that?, Who leaves their bra at a yoga studio and drops it in the laundry basket?” Granted, I get it’s a mistake and someone didn’t mean to leave their bra. There is a mix-mash of underwear, t-shirts and socks that get left at the studio or thrown into the laundry baskets and on a rare occasion someone’s lacy bra, sports bra, underwire support cross your heart kinda thing but I draw the line at taking responsibility of the proper care and maintenance of lady undergarments…this is not what I signed up for. To the lady that gets her sports bra with the push up support that I don’t know what it is….I’m sorry, I think I did a bad thing when I dried it in the dryer but this is your fault…not mine.<br />
All my Love,<br />
