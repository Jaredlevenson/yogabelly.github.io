<p>Its day 9 of the 30 day challenge and I feel like I am running around like a chicken with its head cut off. Its been one of those days that I am all over the map. I leave work at 4 (Ive been working since 7 in the morning) and head over to the studio to grab a yoga class before heading home to finish working. There are many work items left to do and Yoga Belly things that I need to work on (this blog included). I roll in right on time and there is a decent amount of people there for the 4:15 class (Yay!) and grab my spot and change my clothes. Its Barbara West’s turn to do her thing and take me on my yoga journey for the day. Barbara’s Yoga Belly class is much different than Jeff’s from the day before. Barbara has very much the look and feel of Williams’s class. She spent a lot of time working with William to perfect her Yoga belly class so its only fitting that her style resembles his. Her play list is on point, I find myself bobbing my head and notthinking about what a tough days it been. I find myself working my way up from the floor and moving through her flow sequence. The body is still performing above par (for me) considering its 9 days into the challenge. I’ve come to the conclusion that bringing awareness to your practice and showing up everyday makes a significant improvement in your practice. Its one thing to preach it, its another to experience it in your own practice. I’m beginning to really believe that 30 days of this is going to make a big impact not only on my practice but what I am going to look like with my shirt off this summer. It’s exciting. I practice next to a guy who I can tell is a newbie because he is breathing so hard out of his mouth I can feel his breathe on the back of my neck while we are in side plank. He’s watching me while I go through the balance sequence use my towel to get a better grip. I make it a point to go talk to him afterwards and get to know his name and encourage him. He’s complimenting me on my practice which makes me smile inside. I am no master, but after 7 years I bring a certain season to my yoga practice. I tell him…ya gotta start somewhere. We both laugh. I tell him about the trick your mind plays on you about being sore or tired. Theres a big difference between the good kind of sore and injured. You have to learn the difference and know when to rest and when to back off in your practice. I tell him…..You know you don’t have to do everything. You just have to go as many days in a row as you can and take a day off. Then you get back in the studio and do as many days in a row as you can again and again. Before you know it, your practice is in another place. Your doing things that you didn’t know you could do. You’re challenging yourself in ways that you didn’t know were possible. That is the wonder of yoga. I am tired, but I feel good headed back to work. Day 9…..check.</p>
