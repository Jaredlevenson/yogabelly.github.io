<p>Its Day 21 of the 30 Day Challenge and we have passed the 2/3 marker and the end is right around the corner. I’ve been trying to find the time to visit each and every one of the teachers in my personal 30 Day challenge. Matt decided to switch with William (who was subbing for Adam) so he taught the 4:15pm class. Quite a special treat for the 4:15pm crowd to have Yoga Belly primetime serve it up to the early bird crowd. I breeze into class and catch eyes with Kathleen who flags me down to practice next to her. Such a sweet gesture until I realize 10 minutes into class when the heater is blowing directly into my face and I think to myself….Why am I practicing directly in front of the heater? Oh the things you do for the people that you love. It’s all worth it as I sweat out the days frustrations while trying to crack jokes with her and not be rude to the instructor.<br />
It would be an understatement to say that being in Matt’s class is a special experience. He has this way of making you feel like you are here sharing your practice with him when the fact of the matter is that he is the one guiding you through the experience. He brings something unexpected and genuine to Yoga Belly.  There is a peaceful grace in his presentation that is only equaled to the kindness in his mannerism and sincere love in the way he treats everyone . I come up from Shivasan feeling worked out, refreshed and recharged and ready for my evening.<br />
After a day of light practice yesterday, lots of stretching and two full body ball rolling sessions I was excited to practice in the studio with other people. There is something about harnessing the group energy to correct your form and push you to new levels of understanding and strength. I wonder what I will do when the challenge is over. Will I continue to push myself to practice daily? Will I blog? I have to set some intentions for when this is over. I don’t know if I can go back to practicing part time when this is over. I can’t imagine not embracing the openness that comes with a daily practice. The freedom that comes with embracing movement. The daily practice of discipline both physical and mental.  I would be interested to hear how the challenge has impacted the way that you practice. Will it impact your practice post challenge? Just wondering… Day 21 yoga….check!<br />
