<p>I'm going to start with a quote to spin it in another direction. John F. Kennedy, "ask not what your country can do for you -- ask what you can do for your country." That sentiment is just as applicable to many other things in life, including yoga. Ask not what yoga can do for you, ask what you can do with yoga. Sure, I've taken certain liberties with "for" and "with" but I'd say that by doing something with yoga, you are in affect doing something for yoga. </p>
<p>Let's skip past the semantics though. The important thing is to take ownership of your practice. We are guides, nothing more. You know better than anyone what's right for you, how you want to use yoga in this particular moment as a physical, mental, or emotional tool. Granted, sometimes yoga uses you. </p>
<p>It's your practice. You are the owner, you are the explorer of your Self. You have to figure it out. Take ownership. Control what you can, and the rest will follow. And as Will would say, "Right! I love that!" Happy May Challenge. Happy Memorial Day Weekend!</p>
