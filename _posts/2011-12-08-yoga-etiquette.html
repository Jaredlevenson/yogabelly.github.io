<p>Yoga is, by nature, an accepting, less "judgy" practice than a lot of other fitness regimes (for lack of a better word), but there is still an unspoken code of conduct. Here are some bits of yoga etiquette that I wish I had known early on:</p>
<p>Before Class:</p>
<p>-Arrive on Time: If you must be late, (it happens), be quick and discreet about it. If you're going to be more than 10-15 minutes late, you may opt to come back another day.</p>
<p>-Turn off your Cell Phone: For reals. Nothing takes you out of your hard earned savasana like the "I'm a Slave for You" ring tone going on in your neighbor's purse.</p>
<p>-Take Off Your Shoes: No shoes in the studio! Gross!</p>
<p>-Don't Be a Mirror Hog: Be aware of mirror space, and try to avoid plunking down right in front of a fellow yogi, or otherwise hogging the mirror. All you need is a few inches.</p>
<p>During Class:</p>
<p>-Modify Appropriately: Be the master of your own practice, and by all means challenge yourself. Make the practice yours.</p>
<p>-Don't Fall on Anyone: That said, please don't fall on anyone. It's dangerous and not at all cool.</p>
<p>After Class:</p>
<p>-Try Not To Leave Early: But if you must, don't interrupt savasana for others.</p>
<p>-Thank Your Instructor: Respect your instructor by thanking her for guiding you through the poses.</p>
<p>-Give everyone sloppy kisses, heartfelt good byes, and loving booty-smacks!</p>
<p>Heh. That last one is optional. Maybe after you've had a few weeks of bonding with other yogis : )</p>
<p>And now, in case for some reason you ever need to change in public, here's a guide on <a href="http://www.incivilian.net/2011/01/how-to-change-clothes-after-practicing.html">how to change clothes after practicing yoga without inflicting on God and everyone the sight of your splayed buttocks.</a></p>
