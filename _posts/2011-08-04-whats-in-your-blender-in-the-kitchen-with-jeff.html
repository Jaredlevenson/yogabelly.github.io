<p>Or, as I've begun to think of it, Protein 2.0. I tried this smoothie this morning, and it tastes like dessert! But, according to Jeff, it's actually really good for you. In his own words:</p>
<p>"This recipe was adapted from Timothy Ferriss' book, The Four Hour Body.  The purpose of this shake is to speed recovery after strenuous workouts.  There's an incredible amount of protein and Omega-3's in this (as well as fiber if you're using Hemp Protein Powder which I highly recommend).</p>
<p>The two egg yolks have high cholesterol which, according to Ferriss, is essential to producing testosterone which speeds muscle recovery.</p>
<p>Chia seeds are a super food!!  Amazingly high in omega-3's which help the body to repair and keep inflammation down.  They also contain a tremendous amount of antioxidants.</p>
<p>Cinnamon is a natural way to help control blood sugar and as this shake is already low sugar, unlike many smoothies out there, it's safe for most diabetics.</p>
<p>Enjoy!!"</p>
<p>Jeff's Protein 2.0 Super Smoothie:</p>
<ul>
<li>16 oz. milk of your choice (almond, soy, whatever)</li>
