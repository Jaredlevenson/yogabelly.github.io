<div>If you have even remotely considered the possibility of joining the national bone marrow registry, please keep reading.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I am speaking especially to you, my bi-racial/multi-ethnic brothers and sisters, since we, in all our genetically-complicated glory, are under-represented on the registry.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I am speaking especially ESPECIALLY to you, my fellow hapa honeys. Our DNA of mixed-Asian descentÂ is particularly hard-to-find.</div>
<div></div>
<div>One of our Yoga Belly family members has a loved one who needs our help. It's as simple as that.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The process is not nearly as scary as I thought. My uncle donated bone marrow about 15 years ago, and a lot has changed since then. Sometimes, <a href="http://http://marrow.org/Registry_Members/Donation/Donation_FAQs.aspx#what_pbsc">it can all be done without surgery.</a> My uncle is half Korean, half German, and he ended up being matched with a woman he'd never even met before. After the donation, she took him to dinner, showed him pictures of her three kids, and thanked him for saving his life. To this day, he keeps a picture of the two of them framed on his mantle, and they exchanged letters every year. He says it was one of the most meaningful things he has ever done with his life.</div>
<div></div>
<div>If you're interested, please look into registering with the National Marrow Donor Program. Registering as a donor is as simple as a cheek swab. (You must be 18 years old to register.)</div>
<div></div>
<div>Whether or not you decide to register, please spread the word. More importantly, spread the love. It really does make a difference.</div>
