<p>We’ll be using this blog to further the discussions that start in class: about our practice, events at the studio, philosophy, and lifestyle. Here at Yoga Belly, we embrace a more inclusive and lighthearted approach to yoga: as William and Aaron like to say, we offer “yoga for meat-eaters.”</p>
<p>So, welcome to the Yoga Belly family. We’re glad you’re here!</p>
