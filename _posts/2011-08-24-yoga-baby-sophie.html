<p>Hello, all you Smokin' Hot Yoga Moms!</p>
<p>Inspired by <a href="http://yogabellystudio.com/blog/?s=baby+yogi&amp;x=0&amp;y=0">Morgan's adorable 11-month-old yogi</a>, we're kicking off a new series here on the blog: Yoga Babies. Send in photos of your little yogis showing off their tricks, and we'll share them with the rest of the YB family.</p>
<p>Here, we have Thoa's daughter working on tanning the soles of her feet on vacation in Puerto Rico. So THAT'S what happens when your mom's a yoga instructor!</p>
<p>To send in photos, please email the general mailbox atÂ info@yogabellystudio.com.</p>
