Its Day 24 of the 30 Day Challenge and I made another date with Tiffany to practice with Jeff at 5:30pm. I’m reminded of the joy that Yoga can bring you if you allow it to. If you are at Yoga Belly and all you are getting out of the experience is a workout you are selling the experience short. When I walk in and see those smiling faces. A kiss hello from Tiffany. A few minutes on the couch with Logan talking shop about mobile apps and his practice. Hello’s from Ton, Therese, Edna, Stasha, Jeff walking around with his headband on. Venya and I say hello again. We met for the first time last week. Friends old and new…. About to go on a journey through movement. A physical expression of the mental and emotional journey that I am going to share with 25 other people. I’m such a fan of Jeff’s yoga practice. Having the chance to call him a friend now and knowing the man that he is my feelings for his insight has only grown deeper over time. He finds a way to push me in ways that I do not expect. I’m moving through my practice and he calls out a clapping push-up and I feel my upper body push up from the floor move into the air and my hands clap. I’m so thrilled with the fact that I can do it that I do it again. I am a 38 year old 220 pound man, how often in my adult life do I put myself in the position to do a clapping push up. Here is the brilliance of Jeff Lang. Hes not teaching your mothers yoga class. It’s a blend of unexpected movement, yoga asana, his insight….pushing you physically and mentally. I find myself at my edge and something that has only happened a few times in my yoga life. I am emotional. I find my eyes welling with tears as I realize how much I need this release from the tension that I have been holding. I’ve been pushing myself to practice every day and come home and blog about the journey that has brought me to my mat. There have been some major things going on in the background of my life this past month. Every day I sit and reflect on how I chose to make myself a priority and re-center myself on my mat.  Yes my physical practice is changing and growing but more importantly I feel like I understand myself better. How I operate, how I communicate, what drives me to keep on going. The simple choice to put my practice first and meditate on my day everyday has brought more insight and helped to allow me to move smartly through some difficult situations. I peel my sweat soaked self off the mat from Shivasan. I talk with Venya about how much he is enjoying the studio. I say goodbyes to my fellow practitioners. I greet Jen, Stephanie, Matt getting ready to start their journey. I walk out with Jeff to share a parting  conversation and try to catch up on how we are doing since we haven’t seen each other in a couple of weeks. I float home on a high. I have shifted my minds eye to not focus on the problems but on the hope that life only gets better if you invest the work to make it that way. Day 24 yoga….check!<br />
