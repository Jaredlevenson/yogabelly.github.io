<p>It's official, Fall is here. It rained on Saturday, and in my mind, we went from Summer to Winter in about three days. I can never pick a favorite season, but this <em>transition</em> is always my favorite: maybe it's just because I'm a teacher, and my heart follows the academic calendar, so every time the leaves turn I instinctively think <em>new. </em>For most people, spring is the season of newness, but for me, it's the deepening from summer to fall. From sweaty days out in the sun to cozy nights curled up with a book. If I had a fireplace, I'd say, "in front of the fire," but right now a candle will have to do.</p>
<p>One of my favorite things about fall is the tea. In the summer, I drink light, green, citrus-y teas, but in the colder months, I prefer something sweet and spicy. I also need to battle the countless germs that my students bring in, and try to keep my classroom from turning into a petri dish. I don't know much about the health and wellness benefits of tea, but if you're interested, <a href="http://www.yogajournal.com/health/1614">Yoga Journal has a guideline for fall brews</a> that will help ease you into the phase of shorter days, colder nights, and showing up to the studio super early just to defrost.</p>
<p>So tell me, what's your favorite cold-weather tea?</p>
