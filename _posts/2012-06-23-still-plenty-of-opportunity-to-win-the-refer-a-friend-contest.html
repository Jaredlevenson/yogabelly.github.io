Many thanks to everyone that has referred someone over to Yoga Belly. As you can see from the results so far that there is still plenty of opportunity for someone to refer people over and claim the top three prizes for the competition. First Prize being a 25 class pass, Second Prize being an outfit from Lululemon and the Third Prize being a Microdermabrassion treatment from Khuu Dermatology and Dentistry in Mountain View. Its the last full week of the contest coming up and from the looks of things still plenty of time to pull ahead in the contest if you can talk your friends and family into trying Yoga Belly! </p>
