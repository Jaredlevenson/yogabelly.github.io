<p>Day 14 of the Challenge and another day, another challenge to face (no pun intended). A lady named Diane that I know through some close friends that I haven’t seen in a while passed away over the weekend. I had the pleasure of knowing her through a girl named Veronica who Diane was close with through-out the years. Veronica is very sad and I reached out to her to express my sympathies for her loss and to tell her I love her. I went to my mat today with a lot on my mind and I wouldn’t describe my practice to be focused or mind-blowing. I went there to set my intention to send my energy and good will to my friend in need. I dedicated my practice to Veronica. My friend for the past 15 years and the sweetest woman with the thickest accent that somehow has remained despite living in California for as long as I have known her. Veronica is kind and faithful, hard-working and the kind of friend that will be there for you when you need her to be there for you.<br />
When my sister passed away a few years ago I learned that not everyone is going to make it to the end of the story. We all have our time here on earth to touch lives and make a difference in the world. Some peoples time are shorter than others. Making a difference in the world doesn’t start by going to 3rd world countries and starting a school for the underprivileged (unless your Oprah). Making a difference in the world is the world in which you live. The friends you make. The kindness you show to strangers. The time you take to show others you love them. Dedicating your practice for me is not only about sending your energy to the object of your dedication but about coming to a conclusion about how you will choose to react to life when it throws you a curveball. Thank you William for a wonderful class today where I can harness the groups energy to regroup and realize what is important in my life. See that my world is surrounded with people that share a common goal. I am not alone. I have my health and my sound mind and people that love and support me. As I put my troubles aside and try to lift my legs into the air in a chin stand. Even though Leslie is next to me doing it in a much more graceful way. I lay in Shivasan and my mind comes back to my dedication and I focus my mind’s eye to Veronica as she deals with things that I can only imagine must be extremely hard to deal with. Much love to Veronica and Diane’s family and friends in their moment of need.<br />
