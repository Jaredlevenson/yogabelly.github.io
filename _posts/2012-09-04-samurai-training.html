<p>I was reading over the weekend and happened on a supposed samurai training method for the mind. The story goes that when a samurai was scared or in despair, they were trained to not say "I am scared" or "I am despaired" but rather to say "there is a person who is scared" or "there is a person who is despaired." This detachment from the emotion allowed the opportunity to step back and evaluate the options for addressing a particular situation. The ego is taken out of the picture and they respond in a manner that is balanced with their deep, internal beliefs. It's a way of watching the world unfold around you and be able to say, "hmmmm, that's interesting." Handy stuff both on and off the mat. It's not a ninja trained by ballerinas, but still.</p>
