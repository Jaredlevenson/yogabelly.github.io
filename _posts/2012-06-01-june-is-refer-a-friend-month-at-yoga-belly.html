<p>We just love a good competition at Yoga Belly. This month we have decided to take it easy on you all after the hard work that you put in during the 30 Day Challenge in May. Its time to focus on building our community and sharing the gift of yoga with your family, friends and co-workers. We decided to dig deep into the prize vault and come up with a few prizes that I think you are going to love.<br />
"	First Prize will be a 25 class pass for a members who purchase by the class or a 3 month unlimited pass for subscription members.<br />
"	Second Prize will be an outfit from Lululemon. Please see our very own Lululemon ambassador William for more details on the outfit and what it includes.<br />
"	Third Prize will be a Microdermabrassion Facial from our friends at Khuu Dermatology, conveniently located down the street from the studio at 889 Castro Street. If anyone has any questions about the procedure please let me know and we will get some more details from Duke (the owner and YB member).</p>
<p>             Referrals must enter Yoga Belly referee name on the check-in form and purchase the $40 for 30 or Drop in to qualify to count towards the prize. Good luck everyone. I hope to see you in the winner circle at the end of month.</p>
<p>Much Love,<br />
