<p>Last week, Lorraine posted this on Facebook and I loved it so I just had to share. Happy Monday!</p>
<p>"Any yoga teacher can show you what they can do. A master yoga teacher shows you what you can do. Thank you, Yoga Belly, for having some master yoga teachers." --Lorraine G. Moore</p>
<p>I did a quick online search and couldn't find anyone to credit for that quote, does anyone know where it came from? Or are you just that good, Lorraine?</p>
