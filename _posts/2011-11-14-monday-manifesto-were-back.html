<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>Thanks for your patience while I was MIA last week with a sick grandpa. We'll be back to our regularly scheduled program, starting with smooches for you all.</p>
<p>And for your inner dorks.Â <a href="http://yogabellystudio.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/photo.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-683" title="photo" src="http://yogabellystudio.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/photo.jpeg" alt="" width="92" height="130" /></a></p>
