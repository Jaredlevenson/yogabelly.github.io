<p><strong>It is enough.</strong> Three little words. Like so many other sayings though, it makes me just want to go ahead and quote another saying, "easier said that done."Â For me this is particularly challenging. I was brought up believing that nothing was ever good enough. Every decision is difficult because I wonder if it's the "right" one. No sports performance was ever perfect enough, no grade good enough. To this day I still avoid competitive, perfectionist endeavors (think golf). I am my own worst critic.</p>
<p>So at this time of year, I love hip openers like Piegon (Eka Pada Rajakapotasana). Hip openers require surrender. You can muscle your way into other poses, but not so much with hip openers. They require a calmness, they require a belief that "it is enough," that life is okay, that you are enough. And in that surrender, there's a release of emotion and tension that is nothing short of restorative and energizing as we prepare for the new year. It's like opening up and hitting the reset button.</p>
<p>The next time you get into a hip opener or a pose that requires a little surrender in yourself, inhale and say "It is" and exhale and say "enough." It is enough; you are enough. Perfect and full. Happy holidays friends.</p>
