<p>Yoga Belly celebrates Oneness this month as we turn one on July 30, 2011. Come celebrate with us on Saturday, July 30th for a special day of Oneness: One Year, One-Hour Classes, One Price---Free for all! We will be offering six one-hour classes throughout the day starting at 9am. To see the full schedule and to guarantee your spots, register online now by clicking <a href="https://preview.mindbodyonline.com/ASP/home.asp?studioid=11869">here</a>.</p>
<p>To continue the celebration, come join your Yoga Belly family at the after party at Zen Lounge just down the street at 251 Castro Street, MV 94041 (650) 969-4847. Drinks and appetizers will be served starting at 6pm. Dancing starts around 9pm.</p>
<p>There will also be some changes around the studio as we celebrate this huge milestone... look for drinks (rumor has it that smoothies, coconut water, and kombucha will soon be available in the lounge), discounted YB apparel and accessories (one day only! July 30!) and the return of the elusive $85 special. Get it while the gettin's good.</p>
