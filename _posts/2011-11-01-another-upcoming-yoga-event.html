<p>Good morning lovelies,</p>
<p>Hope you all had a wonderful Halloween / Dia de los Muertos, and are enjoying the weather that is finally starting to feel like fall. I am reveling in the joy and soreness of another private lesson with Edna, which I'll post about later, it was a game changer. There are so many <em>little things</em> to remember in yoga, and though they seem little, they feel pretty significant when you actually dial everything down. But, more on that later, my calves are still twitching.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you're going to be around this weekend, check out the <a href="www.vibhasana.org">Vibhasana yoga conference</a> put on by Almaden Yoga... looks pretty cool!</p>
<p><a href="/images/blog/wordpress-import/2011/11/kauai-waterfalls.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-672" title="kauai-waterfalls" src="http://yogabellystudio.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/kauai-waterfalls-300x198.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="198" /></a></p>
<p>For those of you looking for a little more adventure a little further from home, Edna still has two spots left on her <a href="http://www.yogabarr.com/YogaBarr/Workshops_%26_Retreats.html">Kauai Yoga Retreat</a>... there will be lots of yoga, meditation, outdoor excursions (snorkeling, hiking, beach combing!) and... wait for it... a PRIVATE CHEF. Yes, please! If you're interested, sign up online or talk to her after class.</p>
<p>xoxo,</p>
<p>T</p>
