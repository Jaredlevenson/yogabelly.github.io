<p>Shoulderstand is not an inversion that I've always loved. It's hard to breathe, you have to squeeze everything, and some women *cough* get nearly suffocated by their boobs. Nevertheless, there are many benefits to this position, and inversions in general: they're good for the brain, and can help relieve stress and depression. In particular, shoulderstand can help stimulate the thyroid, and since my thyroid went kaput about ten years ago, I tried to learn to love this pose. I also just love being upside down, and this is a nice inversion for days when I'm too tired to go into handstand or headstand.</p>
<p>I'm not there yet, but <a href="http://www.yogajournal.com/livemag/lmcontent/59">Yoga Journal's video</a> helped. I love practicing at home... with carpet! Hope you enjoy...</p>
