<p>Every once in a while I get the opportunity to hang out with fellow students away from the studio where we can spend some quality time and enjoy each other's company.  And since we've opened the studio, it has been a dream of mine to have my own "hot babes" group, a group of yogis who enjoys hanging out with nerds like me after class. Â I always have a great time with the hot babes just giggling like little girls and acting like we are the chicks from Sex and the City, me being Carrie Bradshaw of course. Yesterday we tried Morocco's Restaurant just up Castro Street next door to Khuu Dermatology (insert plug of my friend Dr. Duke Khuu's facility here).<br />
I hope we get to do more hot babes events in 2012 and that the group continues to grow.  And if you ever wondered what it takes to be a hot babe, all you gotta do is practice yoga with us at Yoga Belly.</p>
