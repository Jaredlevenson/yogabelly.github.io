<p>Dearest yogis!</p>
<p>I've been tragically banned from the studio with a bad case of poison oak (exacerbated by sweating) and I am craving yoga, hardcore. It's been over a week since I've practiced, and I'm miserable about it.</p>
<p>However, my recent grounding has gotten me thinking about ways I can keep myself as healthy as possible <em>without </em>sweating. Obviously, me being me, I started thinking about food. More specifically, about veggies. And smoothies. And protein. (Cue: "Oh my!")</p>
<p>After a little tinkering, here's what I'm drinking right now, as I type this. I've lovingly dubbed it the Popeye Smoothie.</p>
<p>Popeye Smoothie:</p>
<p>1 ripe banana (frozen or unfrozen)</p>
<p>2 handfuls spinach</p>
<p>1 cup soy milk (or almond milk, rice milk, whatever... the only thing I don't recommend is coconut water!)</p>
<p>1-2 tablespoons of almond butter (or peanut butter, cashew butter, whatever...)</p>
<p>1-2 tablespoons ground flax seeds</p>
<p>1 tablespoon chia seeds (optional)</p>
<p>1/2 ripe avocado (optional)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Combine all ingredients in a blender and pulse until smooth. Add ice, if you want it to be more smoothie-ish rather than juice-ish. It's not the prettiest breakfast you'll ever see, but it's soooooo good for you! Yesterday, I actually skipped my morning coffee because I felt so energized after this bad boy.</p>
<p>You really can't taste the spinach. Kale, on the other hand, is pretty noticeable. I don't recommend it.</p>
<p>What are some of your favorite blends?</p>
