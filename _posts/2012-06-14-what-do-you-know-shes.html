<p>Hello lovelies,</p>
<p>Sorry for the radio silence, I have missed you all! I moved to San Francisco in April, life has been nutty, but things are starting to settle down. Just didn't want you to think I had abandoned you/YB/the blog or fallen off the planet. I hope to see you around, happy summer! Rock it, YB style!</p>
<p>Lots of love,</p>
<p>Tristen</p>
