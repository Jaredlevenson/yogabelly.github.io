<p>Last Saturday I had the pleasure of joining my guru and BFF Linda Schlamadinger McGrath at YogaSource Los Gatos as she debuted her Hot Pilates class soon to be offered at their studio in 2012.  Much to my surprise, I ran into my other BFF Christina McLeod Murray of YogaSource Palo Alto who I partially blame for me becoming a teacher today.  Both Linda and Christina were the trailblazers of owning and managing their own yoga studios long before Yoga Belly was even conceived.  And today, both YogaSource studios continue  to support us unconditionally.  It brings me soooo much joy to be part of this community and to know that when the going gets tough, Linda &amp; Christina will always have my back.  Much love and gratitude to you my guardian angels...</p>
