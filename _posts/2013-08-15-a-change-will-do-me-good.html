<p>Change is difficult at times. In my on-going exploration of self-improvement I have already spoken of my desire to live life at a different pace. As part of putting that into practice I have been teaching myself to focus on the little do-able things rather than trying to tackle the big changes first. I was driving to Yoga Belly San Jose the other day and rather than driving on the quickest route possible to get over to the studio I decided to take what I thought was the shortest distance in order to put the least amount of miles on my car. Which being realistic, with all the extra stop lights and wear on my brakes it’s probably a wash for driving an extra mile out of my way to get to the freeway but still it’s an exercise in discipline. Changing your mindset can prove to be one of the more difficult tasks that you can take on as a person on the path of self-improvement.</p>
<p>William and I had dinner with my former former boss at Symantec last night and before we went to the dinner I told William.,"I’m going to try to get through this evening without making any declarative statements." I knew that she would want to hear the story of how I was laid off and would want to know if I wanted her assistance in coming back to the company. The two of us have a natural symmetry working together and I know she values my skill set. She was and is an amazing manager and someone that I would like to be more like in helping people develop their skillset in a chosen profession.</p>
<p>So when the time came and she asked me, “Do you want to come back?” I said, “I’m taking some time to get myself in the place that I want to be in in life. I want to make myself the priority, be present and in a place to give something of quality to a company other than my own <i>(meaning Yoga Belly)</i>. I can’t move backwards working for people that I don’t respect just to receive a paycheck. If the opportunity is right and the management style is in a place that I will thrive in, I’ll consider going back. I don’t think I am finished on the path of my corporate career yet. I have some things that I would like to accomplish in my career still. When the time is right, I will return.”</p>
<p>It would be easy for me to say that I will just jump back into the rat race and earn a paycheck. William and I have made a comfortable living with me helping to support our lifestyle and Yoga Belly. The safe choice is to continue down this path. The not so safe choice is to embrace change and try to improve my situation by being in the place mentally, spiritually, socially and emotionally that I should be in. To take a chance on Yoga Belly and see what the fruition of this dream could be.</p>
<p>I see how people are resistant to change. When we make changes to the instructor line-up at the studio there is a small percentage of people that are angry, a larger percentage of people that need closure and require explanations, the rest either don’t care or are unaffected by the change. Everyone deals with change in their own way.</p>
<p>I want to be the type of person that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is a continual work in progress, is open to change</li>
<li>A student of life until his dying day, realizing that life just gets better as long as you continue to do the work.</li>
<li>Forcing myself to make the tough choices in order to learn the most rather than taking the path of least resistance</li>
<li>Willing to work hard to make change a reality in my life</li>
<li>A person that loves people unconditionally, understanding that part of loving some people is about setting them free from expectation, my own agenda is mine alone.</li>
</ol>
<p>In order for me to be that type of person I must be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Self-aware, how can you move through life unaware of what kind of energy you are putting out into the world</li>
<li>Willing, sitting at home watching TV isn’t doing anyone any good</li>
<li>Loving, the golden rule comes to mind, do unto others as you would have them do unto you</li>
<li>Thoughtful, a plan of attack is always needed when planning to take the hill</li>
<li>Intelligent, continually seeking for personal truth and finding inspiration everywhere. Leaving no stone unturned.</li>
</ol>
<p>I sit and I write my thoughts not just to go on a rant about myself to everyone but to remind myself of who I am, where I am going, and what my truths are. Sometimes amidst all the choices that are thrown at you it’s a good thing to remind yourself of who you are and where you’re going. Best of luck to all of you on your own personal journey of self-improvement. These are just a few notes from my journey.</p>
<p>Much Love,</p>
