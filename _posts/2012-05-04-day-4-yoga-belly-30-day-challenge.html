<p>Its Day 4 of the 30 Day challenge at Yoga Belly and I have much business to attend to today and I am up and at it around 6am. It’s my 10 year anniversary today and I have planned a very special weekend away filled with friends, parties, spa treatments and relaxation. So today I have to get to an early morning class and start my day right and knock yoga out of the park. Here I come and I have Thoa’s 7:15am class in my sights. With the love of my life on my arm, we have business to attend to and yoga to check off our list.<br />
One of the things that I love about going to Thoa’s class was that she was the very first teacher that William and I auditioned to be a part of Yoga Belly. I always reminisce about when we took her class at another studio before we were open and she was fresh out of Teacher Training and slightly green as an instructor. What a difference a couple of years make. When we got there Thoa was telling me how much she is enjoying my blog about the challenge (my first compliment in person, thank you very much) so I thought,” Oh God, here it comes, she’s going to try to kill me.”  After falsely accusing Carlos of taking my sandals since we were wearing the same ones and I couldn’t find mine (turns out William put his bag down on top of mine, sorry Carlos). I was ready to throw my mat down by the window side. Cool side off the room for me since Tiffany isn’t here trying to kill me.<br />
Much to my surprise the pace was on point, she talked about patience and premeditation in your practice. Slow movements between poses. It was great. Just what I needed after the fast pace of Edna and Melissa the days before. Stan and Anna were in the corner for their 2nd class of the day. Side Note folks: Beware of Stan and Anna…their yoga is fierce and they come practically every day, you’re going to have to be focused to beat them in the 30 day challenge folks. I got just what I needed to start my day off right and now I am off to wrap up work before we head out for the weekend.<br />
This begs the question: How will I participate in my 30 day challenge and go away for the weekend? I won’t be able to attend classes at YB this weekend but I have set an intention to practice 30 straight days of Yoga. Our hotel has a Yoga class on Saturday and Sunday I plan on practicing with William. It won’t count towards the contest but it fulfills my intention for May. There is part of me that is disappointed that I cannot do every day at the Belly. Part of me wants to win bad and not be disrespected in my own home by setting the record straight about who’s house this is for our first 30 day challenge….but as a 38 year old man that has grown a little…I know it’s not about that. It’s about honoring my word to myself. Fulfilling my obligations to me. Setting an intention and completing it. Its not about crushing the competition….but who knows what’s going to happen in the next coming weeks. I will keep on trucking on and who knows….perhaps the blog will take a different tone in a few weeks when I am crushing the competition and the blog becomes an ode to my greatness…..who knows….we can only hope. Have a great weekend folks. Next Blog update and results coming Monday. Be safe out there. Be mindful in your practice.<br />
Much Love,<br />
