<p>I wasn't the only one who showed up yesterday at 11:40 and had that forehead-slapping moment of "Oh yeah! I'm 30 minutes late!"</p>
<p>I was in good company, but in case any of you are in danger of repeating my scheduling mistake, don't forget that the schedule changes Will and Aaron emailed us about are taking effect this week. The website has NOT yet been updated, so don't let that fool you! The <a href="https://clients.mindbodyonline.com/ASP/adm/home.asp?studioid=11869">live schedule</a> is updated and accurate, so please refer to it when planning your workout. The website is soon to follow.</p>
<p>Happy Hump Day!</p>
