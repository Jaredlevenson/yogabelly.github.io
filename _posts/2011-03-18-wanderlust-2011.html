<p>I'm sure a lot of you seasoned yogis already know about this, but I had never heard of it until last week. Apparently there is such a thing as the WANDERLUST FESTIVAL, which is an event that celebrates yoga, life, and good old fashioned rock. </p>
<p>Is anyone planning to go? </p>

<p>Bonus points: The Fillmore event is on my birthday... I think it's a sign!</p>
