<p>You guys.</p>
<p>A little bird told me there's a place in Mountain View that has slurpee-style sangria. We know it's not at Cascal. But we. Must. Find.</p>
<p>I think it's high time for a Yoga Belly happy hour. So, I propose some serious business: Let's put together a task force. A fearless, valiant team of yogis and yoginis who can brave the MV bar scene and report back with their findings.</p>
<p>Your mission: Find this elusive slurpee sangria.</p>
<p>Then: We sweat it out, YB style, and then go get drinks. And then summer is complete.</p>
<p>Any takers?</p>
<p>xoxo,</p>
