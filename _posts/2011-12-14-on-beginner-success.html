<p>I was really struck by Matt's post on <a href="http://yogabellystudio.com/blog/?p=737">Chasing Success</a>, especially the part about how quickly you sometimes "progress" in the beginning of your yoga practice. For me, that post hit very close to home, and I wanted to share my thoughts.</p>
<p>Before I started practicing regularly, I couldn't even touch my toes. Touch my <em>toes</em>, kids. I was TWENTY-SIX YEARS OLD. And my toes were out of reach. Also, I would get ridiculously sore after every class. Like, it-hurts-too-much-to-lift-my-arm-and-brush-my-teeth-sore.<em> </em>Honestly, when I first started, I didn't even know hips could stretch, or where my hamstrings were. I would sashay down the grocery store aisles, not sure why my hips felt like jello, thinking, <em>why is my butt so sore? </em>I knew 4 muscle groups: arms, legs, butt, and abs<em>. </em>It was not a pretty picture.</p>
<p>After a few weeks of yoga, that started to change. It didn't take long at all, and before the month was over, I was getting up into headstand. A few classes later, I did a rotating headstand. I busted out astavakrasana after two months. I felt like I was born for this, and should probably see about getting yoga into the Olympics and training for my new career as an Olympic yogini. Because see, that's how I still thought of yoga: that's how competitive I was.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I got a little reality check. I started to learn what yoga was really about (at least for me... some people still want to see it in the Olympics, but that's not my bag anymore), and I started to respect it for what it was. I also began to see my journey through yoga less as "progress" than I did as a way of building my relationship with my body, my balance and focus, and my practice. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that while, yes, my body did change once I started practicing--it got stronger and slightly more flexible-- what <em>really </em>changed was how well I got to know my own body. I got to know my own strength, and how to balance, and how to stack and align my joints to make the poses "click" rather than muscling my way into them. I learned how to push through what I thought was my end range. I learned how to actually stretch. I learned to trust myself, and that even if I <em>did </em>face plant in an arm balance, my face was only a few inches from the floor, and falling didn't hurt. I learned that even if I <em>did </em>try taking handstand off the wall and forgot to engage my core like mad and my feet went sailing over my head, I could catch myself, or at least cartwheel down. I could fall and not flail terrifyingly out of control.</p>
<p>Who am I kidding, I'm still learning. Donkey kicks still scare the crap out of me. But I've taken the word "progress" down a notch, and am thinking of it more like making acquaintance with all my muscle groups. I still get stronger, I still get more flexible, but I've also learned not to flip out at myself for being too tired to get into parsva bakasana. I am learning to ignore the urge to "win," to "progress," to "conquer" the splits or tittibhasana.</p>
<p>I am, ironic though it is, learning to play.</p>
