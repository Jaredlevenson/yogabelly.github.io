<p>Yesterday was the long-awaited Groupon release, and as of twenty-two hours ago, 300 coupons were sold. Which means our Yoga Belly family is growing strong! </p>
<p>So, to the newest additions to the family, welcome to Yoga Belly. We work hard, we play hard, and we are glad you're here. Let's get our shake on. (For you "yoga virgins," you'll soon find out what that means... consider yourselves warned! : ))</p>
