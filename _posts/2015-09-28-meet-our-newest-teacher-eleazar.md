From a young age Keshia had always been active. Studying classical ballet in Sydney, AU then receiving a black belt in Tae Kwon Do before entering college, and regular gym exercise after that. After a set routine, she was looking for something different and a friend persuaded to try Yoga Belly. After several failed yoga attempts, she decided give yoga another try. From the first class, she was hooked. The challenge of flowing and being mindful of the breath and body was something she wasn’t aware of through other workouts.
Finishing Yoga Belly’s teacher training and mentoring under Yoga Belly’s own Sean and Loran Loosli, she was able to expand her yoga practice. Keshia would like to share her love of yoga and Yoga Belly to others and hope to open them up to their potential and find their strength. After all, she too is still a student!
Outside of yoga, Keshia works in commercial property management, loves to hike, and likes to smoosh her dog’s face because he’s so gosh darn cute!

Please welcome Keshia to the Yoga Belly family!
