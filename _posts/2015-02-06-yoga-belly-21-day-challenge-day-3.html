<p>	Day 3 of the challenge was today and not yesterday because I ended up having to sub for Mr. Jeffrey Lang’s Thursday night class. We needed a reserve beard to fill in for the mighty bearded one and I stepped up to the plate to help out. I taught the 6am, 9:15am, Noon in San Jose and then popped over to Mountain View for a little love. So basically I was exhausted by the end of the day. See….I told you I would find an excuse to skip a day. But, less judgment and more compassion, that’s what this month is all about, I am dealing with myself and putting myself back on track with my practice.<br />
	Today I decided to take our newest teachers class, Sharon Peleg, at noon on a rainy Friday afternoon. Having never experienced her class since William auditioned and hired her I was pleasantly surprised to see some elements in her class that I really admire in yoga teachers. Unique sequencing, fresh / interesting transitions and that silky smooth voice. That voice is kind of magical. Kind of makes you want her to whisper dirty talk in your ear. I found myself listening to her with my eyes clothes and getting lost in the sound. It’s really quite….mesmerizing. I enjoyed myself thoroughly.<br />
	As far as my practice is concerned I am still coming in at a mighty 65% of effort. Taking it easy on the mat and just getting used to moving and supporting my body weight. My feet ached this morning after teaching 4 classes and I find it hard to balance in postures with the feet not being able to properly ground down in the practice. It’s so easy to judge yourself regarding what you can or cannot do on the mat. I remind myself that it is not about the pose but rather the spirit with which I approach the mat and the willingness to show up, move, breathe and live. I’m still waiting for that moment when I say to myself….Damn…that was good. I know if I keep on showing up. It will happen. Happy Friday Yoga Belly. See you on the mat soon.</p>
<p>All my love,<br />
