<p>Yoga Belly 21 Day Challenge – Results</p>
<p>What a whirlwind February has been. I started off strong with taking classes and writing blogs regarding my journey but soon into the month we started Yoga Belly teacher training and I was refining the curriculum and working full weekends and things started to slip. I have continued to take classes this month but writing the blog became overwhelming. Something had to give so I figured the easiest thing would be to post-pone my written ramblings. My apologies for not following through on my intention for this challenge. Good news is that participants finished strong and prizes have been picked at random from the list of people that completed the challenge. Thank you for everyone that participated in the 21 Day challenge. Here is a complete list of winners in no particular order.</p>
