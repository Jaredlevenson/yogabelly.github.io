<p>I'm not sure if y'all noticed but Yoga Belly is sooo big on posting selfies &amp; taking pics of our lovely yoga community. So in the month of April we thought: Hey gurl, why not make taking selfies a challenge for our students and award one lucky winner (one for each location) free yoga coz that's how we roll?</p>
<p>Okay so in the month of April 2014, we present to you our very first Yoga Belly Selfie Challenge #yogabellyselfie. The rules are simple: Take a fun selfie in your Yoga Belly gear---it doesn't have to be a gnarly yoga pose---something that "pops" and stands out. Then simply post it on Yoga Belly Facebook page, write where you took the selfie, slap on #yogabellyselfie and hit "Post." Our hope is that your pic gets hella "likes." The selfie with most "likes" wins 2 consecutive months of free yoga. Yes, it's that simple.</p>
<p>Here are the deets of the challenge:</p>
<p>You gotta be wearing a Yoga Belly shirt in the selfie and the YB logo must be at least 80% visible, give or take.</p>
<p>You gotta take the selfie somewhere in Mt View (for YBMV Facebook) or San Jose (for YBSJ Facebook).</p>
<p>You can submit up to 4 pics (once a week only please).</p>
<p>Selfie challenge takes place April 1st to April 30th.</p>
<p>Most "likes" on FB will be tallied then winner will be announced by May 5th.</p>
<p>Yoga Belly students only can participate in challenge (sorry YB team, you are out).</p>
<p>There is no sign up or formal registration required for this challenge.</p>
<p>To help you participate we are offering Yoga Belly brand shirts at 50% off this weekend from 3/28-3/30. Get yours while supplies last. Limit one shirt per participant. We have a limited supply so please play nice.</p>
<p>Please send any questions you may have to info@yogabellystudio.com.</p>
