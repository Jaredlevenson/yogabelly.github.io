<p>Sometimes it feels like I'm late for something every day of my life... I spend a decent amount of time running around like a chicken with my head cut off, and no, the irony of rushing to yoga so I can relax does not escape me. And running around on weekends! Oui. Crazy talk.</p>
<p>Though I feel late, sometimes I'm. Not. And when I am, who. Cares. Deep. Breath.</p>
