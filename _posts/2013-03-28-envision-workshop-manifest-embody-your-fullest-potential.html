<p>Wondering what the Envision Workshop® is all about? Well I'll tell ya. First off it was created and will be led by the beautiful Vidya Heisel, who also created our Lotus Frog International Teacher Training that we love so much! Her visit is going to be a real treat for all those that have done teacher training and are in the process of accomplishing their own. But also anyone can come to this workshop to learn and be enlightened by this "life-transforming practice."</p>
<p>The Envision Workshop® has techniques from Neuro Linguistic Programming and Hatha and Kundalaini inspired movement. You will be able to find yourself in the practice as well as do some partner work.</p>
