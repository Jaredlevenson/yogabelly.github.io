<p>Last weekend, I joined some friends for a mini-vacation at Big Bear Lake and got my first taste of Paddle Board Yoga. It's pretty self-explanatory, you just practice yoga on a paddle board and try not to fall off-- it forces you to balance, and practice deliberately, rather than sloppily. It is, to put it mildly, <em>challenging. </em></p>
<p>But so, so beautiful! And, if you don't mind some swimming with your yoga, it's pretty fun.</p>
