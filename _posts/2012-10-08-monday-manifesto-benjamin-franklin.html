<p>Benjamin Franklin. You know this guy: signer of the Declaration of Independence, Ambassador to France, Playboy, Scientist, first Post Master of the USPS, Writer, lead Singer of Bennie and the Jets. Okay, maybe not that last one.</p>
<p>He was ridiculous for his accomplishments in various fields. My dad once called him the Thomas Edison of his day. 1) You shouldn't under estimate my dad's bravado on this matter. 2) He looks to be quite more than that.</p>
<p>He had a quote, a simple quote: <em><strong>"Let the experiment be made."</strong></em> You don't know? You don't know unless you try. Try it out. Go figure it out. Challenge your own status quo. Just don't go get electrocuted, okay?</p>
