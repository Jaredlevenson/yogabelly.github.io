<p>We yoga teachers know a thing or two on space. You know, all floaty without gravity, stars in the sky kind of space. Like for example on <em>Friday</em> morning that the Space Shuttle Endeavor is scheduled to do a low flyover salute at Ames Research Center. Of course technically it's won't be flying. It'll be riding the backside of it's modified 747 all-american, cowboy style. That's how we roll.</p>
<p>Here's the actual details. Flyover is now scheduled at Moffett sometime between 9-9:30am and Moffett will be open to the public. Riding bikes is probably a better plan and you can register atÂ http://shuttleflyover-eorg.eventbrite.com/.</p>
<p>What would be my favorite yoga pose in outer space you ask? That's easy. Headstand.</p>
