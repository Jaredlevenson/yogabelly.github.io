<p>In just 11 days, my lovely friend and Power Goddess Linda McGrath will lead a special power yoga class to raise awareness (and hopefully some money) for Insight World Aid (IWA), a non-profit of the insight meditation communty that provides volunteer aid to impoverished communities world-wide. IWA was initiated by members of the Insight Meditation Center of Redwood City in order to provide opportunities to practice compassionate action.</p>
<p>Linda's class will also kick off a series of workshops in the next few month, a series which we call "Tributes."  With Tributes, we are presenting teachers who have paved the way for us as students, teachers, and studio owners.</p>
<p>For now, let me share with you a little Q&amp;A I had with Linda... Linda darling, thank you for being a sport!!</p>
<p>1.  If I had never taken your yoga class before, what can I expect from your class?<br />
I am passionate about greater quality of form, elegance and continuity in movement, and a strong connection to the breath. A lot of people walk out of my class saying it’s the hardest class they’ve ever done and I think they mean that as a compliment.</p>
<p>2.  Any personal heroes?<br />
I like that Jonas Salk declined patenting the Polio vaccine. He was in it for the passion of his work and his generosity made a huge difference.</p>
<p>3.  What's your favorite comfort food?<br />
Fish and chips, salad, and Champagne.</p>
<p>4.  What inspired you to want to teach yoga?<br />
I could not articulate an answer for you. It’s deeply existential, like having children. “In the deepest hour of the night, if you were asked if you would have to die if you were forbidden to write, look deep into your heart for the answer spreads its roots, and ask yourself  - must I write?” It’s a quote by Rilke. And I’ve heard that Lady Gaga has a tattoo of it on her thigh. Will, I thought you would appreciate that.</p>
<p>5.  What are you currently working on in your own personal practice?<br />
Having a goal or intention never works for me. I spend too much time over-thinking it. So I like to just show up. I almost always get what I need.</p>
<p>6.  If you're not doing yoga, what is your go to physical activity?<br />
I love to swim and ride horses and I can get down pretty well for a white girl.</p>
<p>7.  Any thoughts on yoga being dangerous or bad for your body?<br />
Of all the movement lifestyles, being sedentary is the most dangerous one and practicing yoga is among the safest ones.</p>
<p>8.  3 words that describe you.<br />
Seriously?</p>
<p>9.  If you can have dinner with any 3 people alive or dead, who would they be?<br />
The original Buddha, Csikszentmihalyi (it took me a long time to learn how to pronounce it but his book “Flow” is my bible) and myself the day before I die.</p>
<p>10.  You stub your toe on the coffee table.... You scream out:<br />
FUCK! Life needs its exclamation points.</p>
