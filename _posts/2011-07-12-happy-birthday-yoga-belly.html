<p>This month, Yoga Belly turns one. Can you believe it? It seems like just yesterday Will was initiating me into the "ring of fire" and I thought Thoa was joking when she said "Okay now reach up and grab your toes."</p>
<p>We're here. You're here, I'm here, the studio's here, yoga-daddies Will and Aaron are here. This calls for some serious celebration.</p>
<p>Plans are still in the making, but mark your calendar forÂ Saturday July 30th at Zen Lounge. Details to follow.</p>
