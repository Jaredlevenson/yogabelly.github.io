<p>Good morning lovelies,</p>
<p>For those of you who haven't yet had the chance to bear-hug our yoga-mama, Edna's back! Yaaaaay! And, because apparently she can't function without getting on an airplane every few weeks, she's hosting an aMAzing looking retreat next month. Rumor has it there are still a few spots open, so get it while the gettin's good... a week of yoga, meditation, a private chef, snorkeling and beach adventures... yes, please!</p>
<p>If you're interested, holler at your girl or send her an email at edna.barr@gmail.com</p>
