<p>Hello lovelies!</p>
<p>Today, in what is now officially the last half of September, we conclude our summer "What's In Your Blender" series. We've gotten some tasty, healthy recipes from our instructors, and we're going out with a bang. Mr. Matt Sharpe, NASA-brainiac-turned-yogi, shares his smoothie recipe with us:</p>
<div>"Here's my recipe for making smoothies...</div>
<div>1. Ice - duh.</div>
<div>2. 1/2 to 1 whole banana</div>
<div>3. 4-6 strawberries - keep the leaves on, they're edible and contain vitamins. Only eat them if they're fresh and green.</div>
<div>4. plain, vanilla, or strawberry/banana yogurt (single serving or 6 oz)</div>
<div>5. dash of OJ, or honey as an extraÂ sweetener."</div>
<div></div>
<div>Blend until smooth and enjoy!</div>
<div></div>
<div>And with that, happy Friday everyone! Jeff and I are off to go represent YB at the LinkedIn Health Fair today... which means we're doing yoga in front of people, eeps! Though, luckily, Jeff is primarily responsible for rockin' the yoga, I'm just supposed to babysit and make sure he doesn't cuss too much.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Have a great weekend!</div>
<div>xoxo, T</div>
