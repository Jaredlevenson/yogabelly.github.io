<p>Hello Lovelies,</p>
<p>Is it just me, or does this Tuesday feel like it should be Thursday? One of those weeks... luckily, we have some eye candy. Topher Simon just released the fabulous photos he took of our lovely instructor, Wendy Howell. Look for it on the YB website soon!</p>
<p>If you can't wait that long, <a href="http://www.tophersimon.com/wendy-howell-yoga-instructor-bay-area-promotional-photography/">here's a sneak peek</a>.</p>
<p>I'd also like to give a quick shout-out to Wendy's daughter, the adorable Lauren, who sometimes moonlights as the YB Savasana Fairy. Thank you for sharing your wonderful energy with us at YB, we hope you're excited to go back to school... even though we'll really miss our visits from the Savasana Fairy!</p>
