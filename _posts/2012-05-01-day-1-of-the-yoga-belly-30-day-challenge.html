<p>Its Day 1 of the 30 Day challenge at Yoga Belly and I am excited to set the intention of taking at least 30 straight days of yoga. Of course I took a week off from Yoga prior to the challenge so I woke up this morning at 6:00am excited to go to Williams 7:00am yoga class. Usually I try to avoid Williams class like the plague. Don’t get me wrong, he’s a phenomenal instructor and I am fully supportive of his journey but those of you that are married for a long period of time will feel me when I say that the thought of listening to your spouse speak for 60 to 90 minutes at a time without being able to respond is not at the top of my priority list. But this isn’t about my wants or desires. This is about setting an intention and seeing it through.<br />
I look at my work schedule to see what my options are going to be for including yoga in my day and I know that i’m going to the Avengers premiere tonight put on by my company, I can’t take lunch classes because I have meetings, so it’s got to be before I go to the office….William it is. Its always nice to see familiar faces in the morning. Melinda greets me at the door, we haven’t seen each other in a while so when I tell her that I checked in online she gives me the speech about thanking me for checking in ahead of time to guarantee my place and making it easier for the check in person. I smile cause she is just saying it to let me know she takes her job seriously. I appreciate that about Melinda. She cares about Yoga Belly, she makes it a point to tell me in her own way. I love that.<br />
 I slip off my shoes and go inside, scan the room and I see Terry across the room who is a new friend so I go and put my mat next to hers. It’s always nice to practice with a friend. I say hello to Stan and Anna…Eli is back and I shake his hand. William is ready to begin so I sink myself into child’s pose and listen to his morning monologue. He’s really good about talking and getting everyone in the Yoga Kula to introduce themselves. The people he knows better than others he says their name and greets them with a smile. He’s a very special teacher and I think to myself… I should go to his class more often. He embodies a lot of things that I love in a Yoga instructor. 60 minutes later the class ends and I have given it a good 70% all through the class….I’m pacing myself. Slow and steady wins the race. Day 1 of the Yoga Belly 30 day challenge is complete…..check!<br />
Good luck everyone….see you at the finish line!<br />
