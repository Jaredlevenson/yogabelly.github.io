<p>You can look at my bio and know that one of the reasons that I do yoga is because I want to be prepared for anything that life wants to throw my way, both mentally and physically. It's good to be stretched, grow, and build strength. Yoga can teach you ways to do this safely including things like proper alignment and helping to build proper posture. Practicing yoga makes you (whether you want to or not) become very attuned to your muscles, movements, and your body. The body naturally wants to be a certain way and aside from yoga, I take the principles of alignment and muscular cues into other areas of my life like driving position, bike riding position, desk position. </p>
<p>Working at a desk all day I'm a little fanatical when it comes to ergonomics. Knees, hips, shoulders, wrists, neck, eye level - they all have a place. The downside to practicing a lot of yoga is you can absolutely tell when something is not right. Working from home forced me to work from the couch, the coffee table, and the kitchen bar. My neck and shoulders are now killing me. I do yoga to be prepared for anything - except apparently working from the couch. </p>
<p>I wasn't prepared for that!</p>
