<p>During the summer, I find myself traipsing to and from vacations, weekend getaways, the occasional bender... not that I'm complaining! And, in the summer, my body confronts various maladies that don't seem to affect it during the rest of the year: poison oak, sunburns, mosquito bites. They have kept me out of the studio for whole weeks! It feels like I take three giant steps backwards by the time I get back to the studio, even if I've only missed a few days. But, I don't think saying no to adventure is the answer! It's just that, even away from my Yoga Belly home, I need to take the time to stretch. To relax. To breathe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this spirit, I hope you all...</p>
