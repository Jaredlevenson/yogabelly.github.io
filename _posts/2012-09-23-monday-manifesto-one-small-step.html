<p>Sure, it's not Monday yet - but this deals with how you might start your Monday morning. On mornings when I find it difficult to get out of bed because I'm tired or exhausted, there's a quote that I sometimes say that helps me get up. Under the context of getting out of bed, it's pretty ridiculous and laughable. I love it.</p>
<p>Here it is:<br />
"There's one small step for a man. One giant leap for mankind."</p>
<p>With the first sentence I put the first foot on the floor. The second sentence the second foot goes down and I stand up. One step at a time folks. One step at a time. Happy Monday. Happy week.</p>
