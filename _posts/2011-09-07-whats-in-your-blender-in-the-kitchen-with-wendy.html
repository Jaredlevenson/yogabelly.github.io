<p>Happy Hump Day, my dears! Hope you all are well and enjoying the short week. Tomorrow, I head down to Big Bear for a long weekend of lounging, swimming, and, wait for it... a WATER TRAMPOLINE. I know, right? My life will soon be complete. I'm convinced that I haven't really lived until I've jumped as high as I possibly can and tumbled into a lake, which is my first order of business once we get there.</p>
<p>Anyway, today, we're in the kitchen with Wendy Howell, the lovely lady behind the <a href="http://www.tophersimon.com/wendy-howell-yoga-instructor-bay-area-promotional-photography/">Topher Simon photo shoot</a> that we posted  a while back. She's sharing her latest summer smoothie recipe with us, so take it away, Wendy!</p>
<p>"Try this one on for size!</p>
<p>2 cups strawberries</p>
<p>1 cup watermelon</p>
<p>¼ cup strawberry honey Greek yogurt</p>
<p>2 capfuls strawberry balsamic vinegar (hard to find …. Farmer’s Market item)</p>
<p>Blend and enjoy!"</p>
<p>Sounds deeeeeeeeeeeeelish...Imma have to track me down some of that strawberry balsamic vinegar. Thanks, Wendy!</p>
