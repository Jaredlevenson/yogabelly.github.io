<p>Yoga Journal has a hilarious blog post about the signs that you might be becoming a yoga snob! Luckily, here at Yoga Belly we laugh in the face of tipping-tree-poses.</p>
<p>So, I’m curious… what keeps you grounded? What keeps you from taking yourself too seriously? For me, it’s those blasted chaturangas… no matter how many I do (or don't do), they keep me shaking and giggling just inches from the floor. It’s hard to take yourself seriously in such a position.</p>
