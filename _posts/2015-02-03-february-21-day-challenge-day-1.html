<p>I am getting a slow start to my 21 day challenge. It’s already day 3 of Feb. and I have just completed Day one of my challenge. I’m pretty sure that it’s going to come down to the wire and I will have no extra days left by mid-month and have to go everyday till the end of Feb. I haven’t exactly been super disciplined lately and this is going to take sheer determination to be mindful of the words that I have put out into the universe and follow through once I have set an intention to complete the challenge. I decided to start my challenge off with my husband’s class at noon in San Jose. I am trying to take all of the YB teachers this month and switch it up. There are 21 teachers at YB so this will have to be a feat in planning and getting myself out of my routine and trying new timeslots.<br />
	Days like today I am reminded how lucky I am to share my life with an amazing yoga teacher like my husband. It’s hard at times to view him in the same light as everyone else because I tend to get caught up in William the person and forget that we have been on this yoga journey together for a decade now and I am lucky to have someone that I share my life with to walk side by side. He makes me a better teacher, I have someone to nerd out with yoga. I get to talk about the sequences I love and the unique transitions, when I learn a new move or when he learns something we share with each other the little victories we take along the path. I feel lucky today. This isn’t something common among the other people I know. The person that was there on my first day sharing in my personal practice is there 10 years later sharing in my path as an instructor.<br />
	I’m happy to be back on my mat today. It’s a good day. I hope you all are enjoying your time in the challenge and reconnecting with your practice at another level. It’s a magical journey if you find the time and place for it in your life.</p>
<p>All my love,<br />
