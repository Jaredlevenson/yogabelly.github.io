<p>We might be too cool for school, but the nerdy English teacher in me just had to share this anyway. At least she does yoga, so, umm, hopefully this isn't too random.</p>

<p>"The eyes of the future are looking<br />
back at us and they are praying for us<br />
to see beyond our own time. They<br />
are kneeling with hands clasped that<br />
we might act with restraint, that we<br />
might leave room for the life that is<br />
destined to come. To protect what is<br />
wild is to protect what is gentle.<br />
Perhaps the wilderness we fear is the<br />
pause between our own heartbeats,<br />
the silent space that says we live only<br />
by grace. Wilderness lives by this<br />
same grace. Wild mercy is in our hands."</p>
