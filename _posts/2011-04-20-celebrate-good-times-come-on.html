<p>Happy Passover to everyone around the world celebrating freedom, new life, and the courage to take control of their destinies.</p>
<p>Even if you've never hunted for the afikoman or choked down maror, I invite you to think about all the ways that you are, and are not, free. What is in your way? What can you do about it? Â What is stopping your loved ones, your state, your country, the world?</p>
<p>What is worth fighting for? What is worth letting go?</p>
