<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/13691614">TerraFlow Video 10:  Krista Cahill's ABCs of Inversions Part II</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/yogaearth">YogaEarth</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>After Edna told me some yogi's spend 30+ minutes a DAY upside down, I started thinking of inversions as more that just fun party tricks (though, give me a glass of wine, and watch out, handstand's coming). So, with our lymphatic systems in mind, Krista Cahill's back with more inversion wisdom... this time, she focuses on shoulder alignment.</p>
<p>Wishing you all a great practice, and a happy Monday!</p>
