<p>I don't know about you guys, but sometimes it seems like yoga works just about every muscle I have... except my butt. And when you've got a little junk in the trunk (ahem, as I do), you want to make sure you don't overlook that muscle group too often.</p>
<p>So, in gleeful anticipation of summer, here are some yoga poses that can help tone that region! Enjoy. http://goo.gl/aSG5C</p>

<p>In a few weeks, you bet I will!</p>
