<p>Its Day 2 of the 30 Day challenge at Yoga Belly and I wake up at 5:30am in the morning and the first thought of my day is….should I go to Yoga at 6:00am instead of 7:15am as I had planned? I uncover a leg and realize that its freezing in my house and quickly the thought of getting up early and going to the studio are quickly rejected. I instead decide that a long restful shower and a brief meditation are in order. When I get to the studio I run into the previous class exiting the building and am greeted with familiar faces smiling and even an invitation to a BBQ at the end of the month from a friend Mel that William and I have gotten to know since the studio opened. I chat briefly with Kathleen about how successful Day 1 of the challenge was (biggest day attendance wise in the history of Yoga Belly ….woohoo!!) and she informs me that if it keeps getting busier that she’s going to have to cut down on the # of days she’s going to be coming to the studio. She prefers the class small and intimate. I smile on the inside because in the same conversation she’s also telling me how she used to not be able to fit into the pants she’s is currently wearing (which are baggy on her) and YB is to blame for her fortunate drop in pant size. I love what people want to say to me about their experience with the studio. All in all, not a bad way to start the day. I open the studio door and Stasha is sitting with our new check-in person training her on the fine art of check-in. Thank God for Stasha, if you haven’t had the opportunity to meet Stasha (she’s mostly there in the evenings, or on days like today she pops up at a random time to do Gods work in the studio) please make it a point, she’s awesome. After she sends me back and forth to my car to get peoples mats and water bottles that they are reclaiming (I emptied the lost and found yesterday out of the studio, it was getting messy)I finally get in,  throw my mat down to claim my yoga space and say hello to Melissa.<br />
Let me tell you….quite a difference between William’s Yoga Belly and Melissa’s Power class. Although both hard in different ways. I find myself sweating like stuffed pig in the first 15 minutes. Yoga Belly starts you on your back and gradually works you up to standing poses. Its designed to be challenging but beginner friendly in that it works you to where you need to be. Melissa’s power class starts off with a couple of Cat / Cows and then she is moving through side plank and push-up to side plank on the other side. She’s moving and getting the body hot and sweaty right off the blocks. 60 minutes later after having pushed , worked, gone upside down, balanced and basically wanting to cry twice. I lay in Shavasan and let myself melt into the floor. I pick myself up and take myself home. I feel good…. Really good. I feel happy. Day 2, Yoga…check!<br />
Best of luck with Day 2 everyone, please remember to be mindful in your practice. Your body changes daily and you have to be aware of what you need today, in this moment. We aren’t having a challenge so you push yourself beyond your limits. It’s about setting an intention for your life and seeing it through in a mindful way. Be safe out there.<br />
Much Love,<br />
