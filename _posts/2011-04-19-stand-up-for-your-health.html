<p>When I was little, fidgeting was generally frowned upon, but according toÂ <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/magazine/mag-17sitting-t.html">an article in the New York Times</a> yesterday, it might just be good for you.</p>

And, on the flip side, we all know people who can pretty much eat what they want, and as much as they want of it, and not gain anything.
