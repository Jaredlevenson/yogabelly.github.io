<p>My gal pal Giselle is coming to Yoga Belly next Sunday March 11th to introduce our students to the world of Jivamukti Yoga. I recently asked Giselle to join me for a quick Q&amp;A session for my blog this week. Giselle, thank you for being a sport and answering my Top 10 Questions...</p>
<p>1.  If I had never taken your yoga class and only heard the music from your class playing somewhere, what kind of feel would I get?<br />
Funky, inspired, and thought provoking</p>
<p>2. Do you have any personal heroes?<br />
My grandmother was and is my hero. She endured a lot with tremendous grace and compassion. I have a few personal heros, one of them is Chrissie Hynde (lead singer of the Pretenders). My life changed when I first heard her voice in 3rd grade. She represents the feminine aspect of a rocker to me. She is an amazing musician, an activist and a rebellious spirit and plays from her heart, fearlessly. She's pushed the envevelope and I always gravitated towards these types of artists. Oh and Yoda!</p>
<p>3.  What's your favorite comfort food?<br />
Chips and salsa.</p>
<p>4.  What inspired you to want to teach yoga?<br />
My husband actually came up with the idea. I thought he was crazy.</p>
<p>5.  What are you currently working on in your own personal practice?<br />
Equanimity.</p>
<p>6.  If you're not doing yoga, what is your go to physical activity?<br />
Trampoline baby!</p>
<p>7.  Any thoughts on yoga being dangerous or bad for your body?<br />
Anything can be dangerous if done unconsciously. Practicing mindfulness is key to a fruitful and long standing practice of any kind.</p>
<p>8.  3 words that describe you.<br />
Spunky, passionate, and compassionate.</p>
<p>9.  You can have dinner with any 3 people alive or dead, who would they be?<br />
John Lennon, Tori Amos, and Jesus. (Mary Magdalene too if I could have 4!)</p>
<p>10.  You stub your toe on the coffee table...  You scream out _???_!!<br />
Fuck!</p>
