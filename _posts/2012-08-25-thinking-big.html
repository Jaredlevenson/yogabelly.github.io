<p>I had the opportunity this past week to experience much of what makes NASA fascinating as part of accepting an award down at Johnson Space Center in Houston. Not only did I have the opportunity to meet some of the astronauts that made the following video but I was absolutely inspired by the images that they shared. The following video was produced using the images taken on board during their recent stay. Just watching the video reminds me how small we are on this planet and beyond. It reminds me of what's important in this moment and this life. Think big, do big things. Enjoy your practice and I'll be playing this song in class again soon.</p>
