<p>Let me introduce you to my 80% rule: <strong>On the first practice after a longer than usual break from yoga because of [enter life altering event(s) here] only give it 80%.</strong> The last two weeks I've traveled for work, gotten sick (twice!), and worked way more hours in my day job than normal. I haven't practiced much. Turns out for me there's been more than one 80% practice.</p>
<p>It's unlikely that on the first practice back I'll be able to pick right back up where I left off. So I bend my knees a lot. Sometimes I drop a knee and take an easier alternative for poses. I'll skip any arm balances or inversions that feel like a stretch. I focus on the breath.</p>
<p>These are some of my favorite practices. There's so much freedom in only going 80%. Don't get me wrong, 80% with a lot of vinyasa and core work can still be sweaty. It can still be a good workout. But if I flop around in balance poses I give myself the benefit of the doubt. There's no ego. There's no expectation. There's so much joy and fun in spending time back on the map that nothing else matters.</p>
<p>It's unfortunate that every practice isn't an 80% practice, but life is too short to cruise through it at 80% speed. Sometimes it's time to go full bore; sometimes it's time to rest. But when that practice is over I simply try and hold on to the joy and fun as long as possible.</p>
