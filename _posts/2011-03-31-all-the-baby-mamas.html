<p>Confession: There may or may not have been a time when I watched Clueless multiple times on a Saturday, practicing saying "As if!" and wishing my hair were long and shiny like Alicia Silverstone's. Which, yes, I now see as silly/troubling, but I've always thought she was adorable... and smart... and now she's pregnant! And she does yoga! Freida, this is for you :)<a href="/images/blog/wordpress-import/2011/03/alicia-silverstone-pregnant-yoga.jpeg"><img src="http://yogabellystudio.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/alicia-silverstone-pregnant-yoga-162x300.jpg" alt="" title="alicia-silverstone-pregnant-yoga" width="162" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-103" /></a></p>
