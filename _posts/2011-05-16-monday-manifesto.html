<p>Getting a head start on Monday without a manifesto. But beautiful nonetheless.</p>

<p><strong>The Summer Day</strong><br />
by Mary Oliver<br />
from New and Selected Poems, 1992<br />
Beacon Press, Boston, MA</p>
<p>Who made the world?<br />
Who made the swan, and the black bear?<br />
Who made the grasshopper?<br />
This grasshopper, I mean-<br />
the one who has flung herself out of the grass,<br />
the one who is eating sugar out of my hand,<br />
who is moving her jaws back and forth instead of up and down-<br />
who is gazing around with her enormous and complicated eyes.<br />
Now she lifts her pale forearms and thoroughly washes her face.<br />
Now she snaps her wings open, and floats away.<br />
I don't know exactly what a prayer is.<br />
I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down<br />
into the grass, how to kneel down in the grass,<br />
how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields,<br />
which is what I have been doing all day.<br />
Tell me, what else should I have done?<br />
Doesn't everything die at last, and too soon?<br />
Tell me, what is it you plan to do<br />
with your one wild and precious life?</p>
