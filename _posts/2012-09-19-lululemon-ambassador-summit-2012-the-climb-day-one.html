<p>Last week I was one of the lucky 70 Lululemon Ambassadors asked to join the Lululemon Ambassador Summit in the lovely city of Vancouver, Canada. When asked a few weeks ago to represent the Palo Alto store, I had no idea what was in store but I bet it would be an amazing adventure. From the moment I arrived at Vancouver airport, I was greeted by four lovely ladies from Lululemon who held a big ass red sign: YOU'RE KIND OF A BIG DEAL. We hugged, we kissed, they escorted me to a cab where I would then meet fellow ambassador Brenda Blanco from New Jersey (Joyzee?). (I actually befriended Brenda and other ambassadors on FB a few weeks ago so lucky me for sharing a cab with my new besty!)<br />
We were whisked away through the lovely streets on Vancouver to see where all the Lulu magic happens. I bet I can speak for Brenda that we felt we were about to enter Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, except all the helpers would be hot and healthier.<br />
We were greeted by the Summit Team and offered a lunch then given a tour. We were assigned a bus that we soon boarded for our first group event: The Grouse Grind.</p>
<p>Holy Mary Mother of God... Climbing the grind, hands down, has got to be one of the toughest things I have ever done!! That shit was no joke. I am not one to hike nor climb a stair master for an hour, but those skills would've come in handy last Monday. I huffed and I puffed and I struggled for most of the way up that mountain. But girl, after an hour of steep climbing I finally made it to the top!!  Sure, it took me a while to catch my breath and to feel my legs again.  But like everyone kept saying, "The view is soooo worth it when you make it to the top," and it was a-maz-ing.  Now where can I get some water?  Thank God the only way back down is via tram ride... Amen to that.</p>
<p>On the bus ride to the lovely Four Seasons hotel, also courtesy of Lululemon, all the ambassadors started warming up towards each other.  We all got our room keys and found out who we get to do The Real World Vancouver with for the next three days.  I was lucky enough to room with David Good, another BFF  I made on FB just a week ago.  David and I hit it off right away.  We were like Laverne &amp; Shirley or Thelma &amp; Louise;  I even called us Will &amp; Jack (David has a cute resemblance to Jack from Will &amp; Grace).</p>
<p>The evening was graced with a fancy delectable spread along with a full bar at the pool area where we got to mingle with all the awesome ambassadors and Lululemon team.  It was only day one yet there was already soooo much love in the air.  Everyone was just so happy to be there, to be present, to be alive.  Dave Goto from Lululemon took to the stage to welcome everyone and became our emcee for the week.  He was sooo charming and uber-friendly just like the rest of his peeps.  What a day, what an adventure, what a night...</p>
<p>And that's only day one.</p>

<p>PS: After all the moaning and groaning and pain and suffering I endured at The Grouse Grind, I am happy to declare that I would do it all over again.  I'll just need a better Lululemon outfit.</p>
