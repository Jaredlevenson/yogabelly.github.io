<p>There's a very provocative, controversial, viral <a title="Yoga Video" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=loszrEZvS_k" target="_blank">yoga video</a> floating around out there with a woman practicing in just her lingerie. Whether you find it offensive or not, underneath it is a very beautiful and inspiring story. One of my favorite teachers wrote a great article to accompany that earlier this week in the Huffington Post entitled, "<a title="Stop Judging and Read" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kathryn-budig/yoga-briohny-kate-smyth_b_1202653.html" target="_blank">Stop Judging and Read.</a>"</p>
<p>It made me realize that sometimes we create our own opinions based on preconceived notions, experiences, morals, etc. We don't know what's going on in someone else's life when their practicing on their mat next to us (or in videos).Â We all have our own expression of yoga. We all have our demons. Celebrate each other's practice, and find your own expression of yoga to change your life.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-855" style="border-style: initial;border-color: initial" src="/images/blog/wordpress-import/2012/03/Screen-Shot-2012-03-02-at-7.07.50-PM.png" alt="Down Dog" width="641" height="350" /></p>
