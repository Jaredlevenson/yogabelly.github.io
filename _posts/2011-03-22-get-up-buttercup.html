<p>I don't know about you guys, but whenever we learn some crazy new inversion in class, I always have to come home and try it about 8,000 times in the privacy of my bedroom and the comfort of wall-to-wall carpet. My neighbors really appreciate all the kicking up against the wall, aka my "handstand practice."</p>
<p>Matt told me to practice inversions in the morning, when the body is rested (as opposed to the second I get home from class, and my arms are already so tired I can hardly brush my teeth without shaking), and the mind is clear. The only problem is, sometimes I don't know how to start.</p>
<p>Then I found this video that starts from the basics of neutral spine all the way up into handstand in just ten minutes. Hello, gorgeous!</p>
