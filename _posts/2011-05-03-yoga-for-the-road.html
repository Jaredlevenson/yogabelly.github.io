Now that the sun's out, my students are in the home stretch and almost out of school, I have the travel bug. Bad.</p>
<p>But, the one thing I hate about vacations (yes, it's true) is missing my yoga-time. Inevitably, I come home and feel like I'm starting yoga all over again, barely able to touch my toes. It's not quite enough to keep me from ever leaving Mountain View, but somehow, even on the beach with a girly drink in my hand, I'll find myself thinking, "Man, I could really use some hip openers right now." (Okay, so maybe I have a problem.)</p>
<p>Luckily, Yoga Journal feels my pain. They've come up with a 17 minute video that I can do in my hotel room. It's no Yoga Belly, and I've never had a hotel room with a disco ball, but hey, it's better than nothing.</p>
