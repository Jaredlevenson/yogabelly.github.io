<p>Amazing work to everyone that took the challenge and made it happen. You should be really proud of all the hard work that you put in. The yoga that we are serving you up in all the classes is designed to challenge you physically and mentally. To do 30 classes in a month is a serious amount of work. Take the day offâ€¦you deserve it!<br />
Much Love,<br />
