<p>Good morning lovelies,</p>
<p>You all met Sophie, the adorable yogini standing on her head, yesterday. Well, today, her mother, our feisty and fiercely-good-looking Thoa van Seventer, shares a smoothie that tastes delicious and actually helps you look good in a bikini. She sent the recipe from the sunny shores of Puerto Rico, and she claims she drinks this twice a day because it's so good!</p>
<p>In a blender, combine:</p>
<p>1 cup of soy milk</p>
<p>1 and 1/2 tbsp of peanut butter</p>
<p>1 banana</p>
<p>2 tsp of cocoa powder</p>
<p>3 tbsp of silken tofu</p>
<p>Blend until smooth, and enjoy!</p>
