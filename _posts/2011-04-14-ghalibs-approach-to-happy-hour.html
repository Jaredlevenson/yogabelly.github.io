Which means it's almost Friday. And yesterday Asya and I met for happy hour instead of going to Will's class, which I was trying to justify, when I came across this poem by the Indian master-poet, Ghalib. I think he'd understand...</p>
<p>For Tomorrow's Sake, Don't Skimp With Me On Wine Today<br />
By Ghalib<br />
Translated by Agha Shahid Ali</p>
<p>For tomorrow's sake, don't skimp with me on wine today.<br />
A stingy portion implies a suspicion of heaven's abundance.</p>
<p>The horse of life is galloping; we'll never know the stopping place.<br />
Our hands are not touching the reins, nor our feet the stirrups.</p>
<p>I keep a certain distance from the reality of things.<br />
It's the same distance between me and utter confusion.</p>
<p>The scene, the one looking, and the ability to see are all the same.<br />
If that is so, why am I confused about what is in front of me?</p>
<p>The greatness of a river depends on its magnificent face.<br />
If we break it into bubbles and drops and waves, we are lost.</p>
<p>She is not free from her ways to increase her beauty.<br />
The mirror she sees is on the inside of her veil.</p>
<p>What we think is obvious is so far beyond our comprehension.<br />
We are still dreaming even when we dream we are awake.</p>
<p>From the smell of my friend's friend I get the smell of my friend.<br />
Listen, Ghalib, you are busy worshiping God's friend.</p>
