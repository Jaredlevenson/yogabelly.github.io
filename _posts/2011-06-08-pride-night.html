<p>Yes, please!</p>
<p>Y'all, Great America is hosting a pride night on Friday, May 27th, from 6pm-2am. This is a private event with rides, live music, and a whole lotta booty-shakin'. There will be performances by Robyn, Dev and the Cataracs, and DJ Hector Fonseca. And, um, did I mention the RIDES?!</p>
<p>Tickets are now $45, prices will go up in a few weeks. Our very own William and Aaron are hoping to get a group of Yoga Belly honeys out there, who's coming?</p>
<p>If you're interested, please contact Aaron and/or William at info@yogabellystudio.com or 650-862-3976.</p>
