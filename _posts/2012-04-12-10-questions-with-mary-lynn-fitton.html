<p>YB Family,</p>
<p>Do you ever look at someone and know in your heart that that person helped shape the course of your life? When I think of Mary Lynn Fitton and look at my life today I see the influence of her lifestyle and her character on my existence. We are definitely not the same person, I detox to retox and Mary Lynn lives her life in service to her family and her community. (I’m more than 99% sure that this is not how Mary Lynn views her life knowing her, but it’s my pedestal and I have placed her there so it’s my version of the story). Mary Lynn introduced me to Yoga and Meditation and the concept of building a daily practice of kindness for others. I wasn’t where I am now in my life and didn’t have much of a viewpoint outside of my own wants and desires at the time. I’ve always been the kind of person that was good to my friends but at that time in my life if you weren’t a friend then I would most likely turn my razor sharp wit on you at any given moment. There was much more going on in my life than just attending yoga classes at the time and I didn’t get into a regular practice until a little later but this year of my life that we shared help set me on a path to forgiveness and healing. Mary Lynn went on to start the Art of Yoga Project and you all know where William and I ended up but I never forgot the poems, the insights, the playfulness and the inspiration that she brought to my life. We see each other occasionally at parties and we always stop and try to catch up with each other and every time our eyes meet it brings a smile to my soul knowing what an impact that a good yoga teacher can have on the people that really need it. It is truly my heart’s desire to provide a place of sanctuary for you here at Yoga Belly where you can find that connection to your true self and take a break from  the daily grind of life. If you are inclined to do so this weekend, please join William and I for a Master Class Saturday April 14th at 2:00pm as we pay tribute to someone that we hold near and dear to our hearts. Class is donation based and all moneys will go to the Art of Yoga Project. </p>
<p>Much Love,<br />

<p>P.S. We asked Mary Lynn a few questions so that you can get a chance to get to know her a little better</p>
<p>1.  If I had never taken your yoga class before, what can I expect from your class? </p>
<p>A good work-out mixed with a bit of spirited fun and self-inquiry.</p>
<p>2.  Any personal heroes? </p>
<p>My mom, My siblings, my husband, my two kids (jack and ellie) and DEFINITELY the girls with whom we work at The Art of Yoga Project</p>
<p>3.  What's your favorite comfort food? </p>
<p>Uncle Eddie's Vegan Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies</p>
<p>4.  What inspired you to want to teach yoga? </p>
<p>The profound healing it brought to my own life.</p>
<p>5.  What are you currently working on in your own personal practice? </p>
<p>Regular meditation and pranayama</p>
<p>6.  If you're not doing yoga, what is your go to physical activity? </p>
<p>Walking my mutt, Waverley, all over town pretty much. I play tennis and ski, both infrequently and terribly.</p>
<p>7.  Any thoughts on yoga being dangerous or bad for your body? </p>
<p>You can certainly hurt yourself in yoga. But the benefits greatly outweigh the risks. Stay very connected to your body, listen to its messages and respond accordingly. Practice self-awareness, be vigilant about linking your breath to your practice, stay out of your ego (as much as possible) and you will reduce your risk of injury considerably.</p>
<p>8.  3 words that describe you. </p>
<p>Mischievous, Energetic, Intense</p>
<p>9.  If you can have dinner with any 3 people alive or dead, who would they be? </p>
<p>This is super hard--I'd say Mary Oliver (the poet), my late grandmother Elizabeth Winger, and Rachel Lloyd (founder of GEMS www.gems-girls.org)</p>
<p>10.  You stub your toe on the coffee table.... You scream out:   _?!@#!!___   Goddamnit! or worse. (My kids are trying to get me to say "Snap!")</p>
