<p>Edna OWNED us Wednesday nooner's and our creeping, sassy hips. We were practicing dancer's pose, a pose I had always attempted with my torso tilted forward, leg kicked up behind me. I was in good company, too, there were a lot of tipping dancers in class that day.</p>
<p>But Edna would have none of it. She told us to make fists and smash our hips down to keep them square. And we had to do a backbend instead of just kicking up our legs. Which was way, way harder.</p>
